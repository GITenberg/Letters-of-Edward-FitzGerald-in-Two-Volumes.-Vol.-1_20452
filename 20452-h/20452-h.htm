v</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p>In compliance with a very generally expressed wish that the 
Letters of Edward FitzGerald should be separated from his 
Literary Remains, they are now issued with some additions to 
their number which have not before appeared.&nbsp; It was no part
of my plan to form a complete collection of his letters, but 
rather to let the story of his life be told in such of them as 
gave an indication of his character and pursuits.&nbsp; It would 
have been easy to increase the number considerably had I printed 
all that I possess, but it seemed better to create the desire for
more than to incur the reproach of having given more than 
enough.</p>
<p>Since these volumes were completed a large number of letters, 
addressed by FitzGerald to his life-long friend Mrs. Kemble, have
come into the possession of Messrs. Richard Bentley and Son, and 
<!-- page vi--><a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
vi</span>will shortly make their appearance.&nbsp; By the desire 
of Mr. George Bentley I have undertaken to see them through the 
press.</p>

<h2>NOTE</h2>
<p>In vol. ii. p. 181 the date 1875, which was conjectural, has 
been changed to 1878, in which year September 22&mdash;the day on
which the letter was written&mdash;was a Sunday.&nbsp; There was 
a Musical Festival at Norwich in both years, and the same 
Oratorios were performed, and this led me to put the letter out 
of its place.</p>

<h2><!-- page vii--><a name="pagevii"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. vii</span>PREFACE TO LETTERS AND LITERARY 
REMAINS</h2>
<p>After Mr. FitzGerald&rsquo;s death in June 1883 a small tin 
box addressed to me was found by his executors, containing among 
other things corrected copies of his printed works, and the 
following letter, which must have been written shortly after my 
last visit to him at Easter that year:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><span 
class="smcap">Woodbridge</span>: <i>May</i> 1/83.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Wright</span>,</p>
<p>I do not suppose it likely that any of my works should be 
reprinted after my Death.&nbsp; Possibly the three Plays from the
Greek, and Calderon&rsquo;s M&aacute;gico: which have a certain 
merit in the Form they are cast into, and also in the 
Versification.</p>
<p>However this may be, I venture to commit to you this Box 
containing Copies of all that I have corrected in the way that I 
would have them appear, if any of them ever should be 
resuscitated.</p>
<p>The C. Lamb papers are only materials for you, or any one 
else, to use at pleasure.</p>
<p><!-- page viii--><a name="pageviii"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. viii</span>The Crabbe volume would, I think, 
serve for an almost sufficient Selection from him; and some such 
Selection will have to be made, I believe, if he is to be 
resuscitated.&nbsp; Two of the Poems&mdash;&lsquo;The Happy 
Day&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Family of Love&rsquo;&mdash;seem to me 
to have needed some such abridgement as the &lsquo;Tales of the 
Hall,&rsquo; for which I have done little more than hastily to 
sketch the Plan.&nbsp; For all the other Poems, simple Extracts 
from them will suffice: with a short notice concerning their 
Dates of Composition, etc., at the Beginning.</p>
<p>My poor old Lowestoft Sea-slang may amuse yourself to look 
over perhaps.</p>
<p>And so, asking your pardon for inflicting this Box upon you I 
am ever sincerely yours</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In endeavouring to carry out these last wishes of my friend I 
thought that of the many who know him only as a translator some 
would be glad to have a picture of him as he appeared to the 
small circle of his intimate acquaintances.&nbsp; The mere 
narrative of the life of a man of leisure and literary tastes 
would have contained too few incidents to be of general interest,
and it appeared to me best to let him be his own biographer, 
telling his own story and revealing his own character in his 
letters.&nbsp; Fortunately there are many of these, and I have 
endeavoured to give <!-- page ix--><a name="pageix"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. ix</span>such a selection from them as would 
serve this purpose, adding a few words here and there to connect 
them and explain what was not sufficiently evident.&nbsp; As the 
letters begin from the time that he left College and continue 
with shorter or longer intervals till the day before his death, 
it was only necessary to introduce them by a short sketch of his 
early life in order to make the narrative complete.</p>
<p>FitzGerald&rsquo;s letters, like his conversation, were 
perfectly unaffected and full of quiet humour.&nbsp; In his 
lonely life they were the chief means he had of talking with his 
friends, and they were always welcome.&nbsp; In reply to one of 
them Carlyle wrote: &lsquo;Thanks for your friendly human letter;
which gave us much entertainment in the reading (at breakfast 
time the other day), and is still pleasant to think of.&nbsp; One
gets so many <i>in</i>human letters, ovine, bovine, porcine, 
etc., etc.: I wish you would write a little oftener; when the 
beneficent Daimon suggests, fail not to lend ear to 
him.&rsquo;&nbsp; Another, who has since followed him &lsquo;from
sunshine to the sunless land,&rsquo; and to whom he wrote of 
domestic affairs, said, &lsquo;The striking feature in his 
correspondence with me is the exquisite tenderness of feeling 
which it exhibits in regard to all family matters; the letters 
might have been written by a mother or a sister.&rsquo;&nbsp; He 
said of himself that his friendships were more like loves, and 
<!-- page x--><a name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
x</span>as he was constant in affectionate loyalty to others, he 
might also say with Brutus,</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
all my life<br />
I found no man but he was true to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Poet-Laureate, on hearing of his death, wrote to the late 
Sir Frederic Pollock: &lsquo;I had no truer friend: he was one of
the kindliest of men, and I have never known one of so fine and 
delicate a wit.&nbsp; I had written a poem to him the last week, 
a dedication, which he will never see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When Thackeray, not long before he died, was asked by his 
daughter which of his old friends he had loved most, he replied, 
&lsquo;Why, dear old Fitz, to be sure; and Brookfield.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And Carlyle, quick of eye to discern the faults and weaknesses
of others, had nothing but kindliness, with perhaps a touch of 
condescension, &lsquo;for the peaceable, affectionate, and 
ultra-modest man, and his innocent <i>far niente</i> 
life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was something to have been intimate with three such 
friends, and one can only regret that more of his letters 
addressed to them have not been preserved.&nbsp; Of those written
to the earliest and dearest friend of all, James Spedding, not 
one is left.</p>
<p>One of his few surviving contemporaries, speaking from a 
lifelong experience, described him with perfect <!-- page xi--><a
name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xi</span>truth as an 
eccentric man of genius, who took more pains to avoid fame than 
others do to seek it.</p>
<p>His love of music was one of his earliest passions, and 
remained with him to the last.&nbsp; I cannot refrain from 
quoting some recollections of the late Archdeacon Groome, a 
friend of his College days, and so near a neighbour in later life
that few letters passed between them.&nbsp; &lsquo;He was a true 
musician; not that he was a great performer on any instrument, 
but that he so truly appreciated all that was good and beautiful 
in music.&nbsp; He was a good performer on the piano, and could 
get such full harmonies out of the organ that stood in one corner
of his entrance room at Little Grange as did good to the 
listener.&nbsp; Sometimes it would be a bit from one of 
Mozart&rsquo;s Masses, or from one of the finales of some one of 
his or Beethoven&rsquo;s Operas.&nbsp; And then at times he would
fill up the harmonies with his voice, true and resonant almost to
the last.&nbsp; I have heard him say, &ldquo;Did you never 
observe how an Italian organ-grinder will sometimes put in a few 
notes of his own in such perfect keeping with the air which he 
was grinding?&rdquo;&nbsp; He was not a great, but he was a good 
composer.&nbsp; Some of his songs have been printed, and many 
still remain in manuscript.&nbsp; Then what pleasant talk I have 
had with him about the singers of our early years; never 
forgetting to speak of Mrs. Frere of <!-- page xii--><a 
name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xii</span>Downing, as
the most perfect private singer we had ever heard.&nbsp; And so 
indeed she was.&nbsp; Who that had ever heard her sing 
Handel&rsquo;s songs can ever forget the purity of her phrasing 
and the pathos of her voice?&nbsp; She had no particle of vanity 
in her, and yet she would say, &ldquo;Of course, I can sing 
Handel.&nbsp; I was a pupil of John Sale, and he was a pupil of 
Handel.&rdquo;&nbsp; To her old age she still retained the charm 
of musical expression, though her voice was but a thread.&nbsp; 
And so we spoke of her; two old men with all the enthusiastic 
admiration of fifty years ago.&nbsp; Pleasant was it also to hear
him speak of the public singers of those early days.&nbsp; 
Braham, so great, spite of his vulgarity; Miss Stephens, so sweet
to listen to, though she had no voice of power; and poor Vaughan,
who had so feeble a voice, and yet was always called &ldquo;such 
a chaste singer.&rdquo;&nbsp; How he would roar with laughter, 
when I would imitate Vaughan singing</p>
<blockquote><p>His hiddeus (<i>sic</i>) love provokes my rage,<br
/>
Weak as I am, I must engage,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>from Acis and Galatea.&nbsp; Then too his reminiscences of the
said Acis and Galatea as given at the Concerts for Ancient 
Music.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can see them now, the dear old 
<i>creeters</i> with the gold eye-glasses and their turbans, 
noddling their heads as they sang</p>
<blockquote><p>O the pleasures of the plains!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page xiii--><a name="pagexiii"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. xiii</span>&lsquo;These old <i>creeters</i> 
being, as he said, the sopranos who had sung first as girls, when
George the Third was king.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was a great lover of our old English composers, 
specially of Shield.&nbsp; Handel, he said, has a scroll in his 
marble hand in the Abbey on which are written the first bars 
of</p>
<blockquote><p>I know that my Redeemer liveth;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and Shield should hold a like scroll, only on it should be 
written the first bars of</p>
<blockquote><p>A flaxen-headed ploughboy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;He was fond of telling a story of Handel, which I, at 
least, have never seen in print.&nbsp; When Handel was blind he 
composed his &ldquo;Samson,&rdquo; in which there is that most 
touching of all songs, specially to any one whose powers of sight
are waning&mdash;&ldquo;Total Eclipse.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Beard was
the great tenor singer of the day, who was to sing this 
song.&nbsp; Handel sent for him, &ldquo;Mr. Beard,&rdquo; he 
said, &ldquo;I cannot sing it as it should be sung, but I can 
tell you how it ought to be sung.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then he sang 
it, with what strange pathos need not be told.&nbsp; Beard stood 
listening, and when it was finished said, with tears in his eyes,
&ldquo;But Mr. Handel, I can never sing it like 
that.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so he would tell the story with tears in 
his voice, such as <!-- page xiv--><a name="pagexiv"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. xiv</span>those best remember, who ever heard 
him read some piece of his dear old Crabbe, and break down in the
reading.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With this I will conclude, and I have only now to express my 
sincere thanks to all who have entrusted me with letters 
addressed to themselves or to those whom they represent.&nbsp; It
has been my endeavour to justify their confidence by 
discretion.&nbsp; To Messrs. Richard Bentley and Son I am 
indebted for permission to reprint Virgil&rsquo;s Garden from the
Temple Bar Magazine. <a name="citation0a"></a><a

1</span>LETTERS OF EDWARD FITZGERALD</h2>
<p>Edward FitzGerald was born at Bredfield House in Suffolk, an 
old Jacobean mansion about two miles from Woodbridge, on the 31st
of March, 1809.&nbsp; He was the third son of John Purcell, who 
married his cousin Mary Frances FitzGerald, and upon the death of
her father in 1818 took the name and arms of FitzGerald.&nbsp; In
1816 Mr. Purcell went to France, and for a time settled with his 
family at St. Germains.&nbsp; FitzGerald in later life would 
often speak of the royal hunting parties which he remembered 
seeing in the forest.&nbsp; They afterwards removed to Paris, 
occupying the house in which Robespierre had once lived, and here
FitzGerald had for his drillmaster one of Napoleon&rsquo;s Old 
Guard.&nbsp; Even at this early period the vivacious humour which
afterwards characterized him appears to have shewn itself, for 
his father writing to some friends in England speaks of little 
<!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
2</span>Edward keeping the whole family in good spirits by his 
unfailing fun and droll speeches.&nbsp; The dramatic 
circumstances of the assassination of M. Fuald&egrave;s, a 
magistrate at Rodez, in 1817, and the remarkable trial which 
followed, fastened themselves on FitzGerald&rsquo;s memory, and 
he was familiar with all the details which he had heard spoken of
when quite a child in Paris.&nbsp; In 1821 he was sent to King 
Edward the Sixth&rsquo;s School at Bury St. Edmunds, where his 
two elder brothers were already under the charge of Dr. Malkin, 
who, like himself in after life, was a great admirer of 
Crabbe.&nbsp; Among his schoolfellows were James Spedding and his
elder brother, W. B. Donne, J. M. Kemble, and William Airy the 
brother of Sir George Airy, formerly Astronomer-Royal.&nbsp; I 
have often heard him say that the best piece of declamation he 
had ever listened to was Kemble&rsquo;s recitation of 
Hotspur&rsquo;s speech, beginning &lsquo;My liege, I did deny no 
prisoners,&rsquo; on a prize day at Bury.&nbsp; When he left for 
Cambridge in 1826 the Speddings were at the head of the 
School.&nbsp; He was entered at Trinity on 6th February 1826 
under Mr. (afterwards Dean) Peacock and went into residence in 
due course in the following October, living in lodgings at Mrs. 
Perry&rsquo;s (now Oakley&rsquo;s), No. 19 King&rsquo;s 
Parade.&nbsp; James Spedding did not come up till the year 
following, and his greatest friends in later life, John Allen, 
afterwards Archdeacon of Salop, W. M. Thackeray, and W. H. 
Thompson, afterwards Master of Trinity, were his juniors at the 
University <!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>by two years.&nbsp; The three 
Tennysons were also his contemporaries, but it does not appear 
that he knew them till after he had left Cambridge.&nbsp; Indeed,
in a letter to Mrs. Richmond Ritchie (Miss Thackeray), written in
1882, he says of the Laureate, &lsquo;I can tell you nothing of 
his College days; for I did not know him till they were over, 
though I had seen him two or three times before.&nbsp; I remember
him well&mdash;a sort of Hyperion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>FitzGerald was unambitious of University distinctions and was 
not in the technical sense a reading man, but he passed through 
his course in a leisurely manner, amusing himself with music and 
drawing and poetry, and modestly went out in the Poll in January 
1830, after a period of suspense during which he was apprehensive
of not passing at all.&nbsp; Immediately after taking his degree 
he went to stay with his brother-in-law, Mr. Kerrich, at 
Geldestone Hall, near Beccles, where he afterwards spent much of 
his time.&nbsp; While there, and still undecided as to his future
movements, he writes to his friend John Allen that his father had
to some extent decided for him by reducing his allowance, a 
measure which would compel him to go and live in France.&nbsp; It
was apparently not in consequence of this, for the difficulty 
with his father was satisfactorily arranged, that he went in the 
spring of 1830 to Paris, where his aunt, Miss Purcell, was 
living.&nbsp; Thackeray joined him for a short time in April, but
left suddenly, and was the bearer of a hurried letter written by 
FitzGerald at the Palais <!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>Royal to the friend who was at this 
time his chief correspondent.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;If you see Roe (the Engraver, not the 
Haberdasher) give him my remembrance and tell him I often wish 
for him in the Louvre: as I do for you, my dear Allen: for I 
think you would like it very much.&nbsp; There are delightful 
portraits (which you love most), and statues so beautiful that 
you would for ever prefer statues to pictures.&nbsp; There are as
fine pictures in England: but not one statue so fine as any 
here.&nbsp; There is a lovely and very modest Venus: and the 
Gladiator: and a very majestic Demosthenes, sitting in a chair, 
with a roll of writing in his hands, and seemingly meditating 
before rising to speak.&nbsp; It is quite awful.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>FitzGerald remained in France till about the end of May, and 
before leaving wrote again to Allen, not perhaps altogether 
seriously, yet with more truth than he imagined, of his future 
mode of life.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I start for England in a week, as I purpose
now: I shall go by Havre de Grace and Southampton, and stay for a
month or two perhaps at Dartmouth, a place on the Devonshire 
coast.&nbsp; Tell Thackeray that he is never to invite me to his 
house, as I intend never to go: not that I would not go out there
rather than any place perhaps, but I cannot stand seeing new 
faces in the polite circles.&nbsp; You must know I am going to 
become a great bear: and have got all sorts of Utopian ideas into
my head about society: these may all be very absurd, but I try 
the experiment on <!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>myself, so I can do no great 
hurt.&nbsp; Where I shall go in the summer I know not.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the end he made Southampton his headquarters and spent 
several weeks there, going on short excursions to visit some 
college acquaintances.&nbsp; In November he was at Naseby, where 
his father had a considerable estate, including the famous 
battlefield, of which we shall hear more in his later 
correspondence.&nbsp; &lsquo;This place is solitary 
enough,&rsquo; he writes to John Allen, &lsquo;but I am well off 
in a nice farm-house.&nbsp; I wish you could come and see the 
primitive inhabitants, and the fine field of Naseby.&nbsp; There 
are grand views on every side: and all is interesting. . . 
.&nbsp; Do you know, Allen, that this is a very curious place 
with odd fossils: and mixed with bones and bullets of the fight 
at Naseby; and the identical spot where King Charles stood to see
the battle. . . .&nbsp; I do wish you and Sansum were here to see
the curiosities.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you come?&nbsp; I am quite the
King here I promise you. . . .&nbsp; I am going to-day to dine 
with the Carpenter, a Mr. Ringrose, and to hear his daughter play
on the pianoforte.&nbsp; Fact.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My blue surtout daily does wonders.&nbsp; At Church its
effect is truly delightful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was at Naseby, in the spring of the following year (1831), 
that he made his earliest attempt in verse, the earliest at any 
rate which has yet been discovered.&nbsp; Charles Lamb, writing 
to Moxon in August, tells him, &lsquo;The Athen&aelig;um has been
hoaxed <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>with some exquisite poetry, that was, two or three months
ago, in Hone&rsquo;s Book. . . .&nbsp; The poem I mean is in 
Hone&rsquo;s Book as far back as April.&nbsp; I do not know who 
wrote it; but &rsquo;tis a poem I envy&mdash;<i>that</i> and 
Montgomery&rsquo;s &ldquo;Last Man&rdquo;: I envy the writers, 
because I feel I could have done something like 
them.&rsquo;&nbsp; It first appeared in Hone&rsquo;s Year Book 
for April 30, 1831, with the title &lsquo;The Meadows in 
Spring,&rsquo; and the following letter to the Editor.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;These verses are in the old style; rather homely in 
expression; but I honestly profess to stick more to the 
simplicity of the old poets than the moderns, and to love the 
philosophical good humor of our old writers more than the sickly 
melancholy of the Byronian wits.&nbsp; If my verses be not good, 
they are good humored, and that is something.&rsquo;&nbsp; With a
few verbal changes they were sent to the Athen&aelig;um, and 
appeared in that paper on July 9, 1831, accompanied by a note of 
the Editor&rsquo;s, from which it is evident that he supposed 
them to have been written by Lamb.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>To the Editor of the 
Athen&aelig;um</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>
<p>These verses are something in the old style, but not the worse
for that: not that I mean to call them good: but I am sure they 
would not have been better, if dressed up in the newest 
Montgomery fashion, for which I cannot say I have much 
love.&nbsp; If they are fitted for your paper, you are welcome 
<!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
7</span>to them.&nbsp; I send them to you, because I find only in
your paper a love of our old literature, which is almost 
monstrous in the eyes of modern ladies and gentlemen.&nbsp; My 
verses are certainly not in the present fashion; but, I must own,
though there may not be the same merit in the thoughts, I think 
the style much better: and this with no credit to myself, but to 
the merry old writers of more manly times.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; And chivalry&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gallant chivalry!</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; I talk of our youth&mdash;<br />
How &rsquo;twas gladsome, but often<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Foolish, forsooth:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But gladsome, gladsome!</p>
<p>Or to get merry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We sing some old rhyme,<br />
That made the wood ring again<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In summer time&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet summer time!</p>
<p>Then go we to smoking,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Silent and snug:<br />
Nought passes between us,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Save a brown jug&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes!</p>
<p>And sometimes a tear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Will rise in each eye,<br />
Seeing the two old friends<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So merrily&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So merrily!</p>
<p>And ere to bed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Go we, go we,<br />
Down on the ashes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We kneel on the knee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Praying together!</p>
<p>Thus, then, live I,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till, &rsquo;mid all the gloom,<br />
By heaven! the bold sun<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is with me in the room.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shining, shining!</p>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Swallows soaring between;<br />
The spring is alive,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the meadows are green!</p>
<p>I jump up, like mad,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Break the old pipe in twain,<br />
And away to the meadows,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The meadows again!</p>

<p>I had very little hesitation, from internal evidence alone, in
identifying these verses with those which FitzGerald had written,
as he said, when a lad, or little more than a lad, and sent to 
the Athen&aelig;um, but all question has been set at rest by the 
discovery of a copy in a common-place book belonging to the late 
Archdeacon Allen, with the heading &lsquo;E. F. G.,&rsquo; and 
the date &lsquo;Naseby, Spring, 1831.&rsquo;&nbsp; This copy 
differs slightly from those in the Year Book and in the 
Athen&aelig;um, and in place of the tenth stanza it has,</p>
<blockquote><p>So winter passeth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a long sleep<br />
From falling autumn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To primrose-peep.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But although at this time he appears to have written nothing 
more himself he was not unmindful of what was done by others, for
in May 1831 he writes to Allen, &lsquo;I have bought A. 
Tennyson&rsquo;s poems.&nbsp; How good Mariana is!&rsquo;&nbsp; 
And again a year later, after a night-ride on the coach to 
London, &lsquo;I forgot to tell you that when I came up in the 
mail, and fell a dozing in the morning, <!-- page 10--><a 
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>the sights of
the pages in crimson and the funerals which the Lady of Shalott 
saw and wove, floated before me: really, the poem has taken 
lodging in my poor head.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The correspondence will now for the most part tell its own 
story, and with it all that is to be told of FitzGerald&rsquo;s 
life.</p>
<p>In October and November 1831 he was for three weeks in town 
with Thackeray, and in the following summer was thinking of 
joining him at Havre when he wrote to his friend Allen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Allen</span>,</p>
<p>. . . And now I will tell you of a pilgrimage I made that put 
me in mind of you much.&nbsp; I went to Salisbury to see the 
Cathedral, but more to walk to Bemerton, George Herbert&rsquo;s 
village.&nbsp; It is about a mile and half from Salisbury 
alongside a pleasant stream with old-fashioned watermills beside:
through fields very fertile.&nbsp; When I got to Bemerton I 
scarcely knew what to do with myself.&nbsp; It is a very pretty 
village with the Church and Parsonage much as Herbert must have 
left it.&nbsp; But there is no memorial of him either in or 
outside the walls of the church: though there have been Bishops 
and Deans and I know not what all so close at hand at 
Salisbury.&nbsp; This is a great shame indeed.&nbsp; I would 
gladly put up a plain stone if I could get the Rector&rsquo;s 
leave.&nbsp; I was very <!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>sorry to see no tablet of any 
kind.&nbsp; The people in the Cottages had heard of a very pious 
man named Herbert, and had read his books&mdash;but they 
don&rsquo;t know where he lies.&nbsp; I have drawn the church and
village: the little woodcut of it in Walton&rsquo;s Lives is very
like.&nbsp; I thought I must have passed along the spot in the 
road where he assisted the man with the fallen horse: and to shew
the benefit of good examples, I was serviceable that very evening
in the town to some people coming in a cart: for the driver was 
drunk and driving furiously home from the races, and I believe 
would have fallen out, but that some folks, amongst whom I was 
one, stopped the cart.&nbsp; This long history is now at an 
end.&nbsp; I wanted John Allen much to be with me.&nbsp; I 
noticed the little window into which Herbert&rsquo;s friend 
looked, and saw him kneeling so long before the altar, when he 
was first ordained.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>In the summer and autumn of this year FitzGerald spent some 
weeks at Tenby and was a good deal with Allen to whom he wrote on
his return to London.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Allen</span>,</p>
<p>I suppose it must seem strange to you that I should like 
writing letters: and indeed I don&rsquo;t know that I do like it 
in general.&nbsp; However, here I see no companions, so I am 
pleased to talk to my old friend John Allen: which indeed keeps 
alive my <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>humanity very much. . . .&nbsp; I 
have been about to divers Bookshops and have bought several 
books&mdash;a Bacon&rsquo;s Essays, Evelyn&rsquo;s Sylva, 
Browne&rsquo;s Religio Medici, Hazlitt&rsquo;s Poets, etc.&nbsp; 
The latter I bought to add to my Paradise, which however has 
stood still of late.&nbsp; I mean to write out Carew&rsquo;s 
verses in this letter for you, and your Paradise.&nbsp; As to the
Religio, I have read it again: and keep my opinion of it: except 
admiring the eloquence, and beauty of the notions, more.&nbsp; 
But the arguments are not more convincing.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it
is a very fine piece of English: which is, I believe, all that 
you contend for.&nbsp; Hazlitt&rsquo;s Poets is the best 
selection I have ever seen.&nbsp; I have read some Chaucer too, 
which I like.&nbsp; In short I have been reading a good deal 
since I have been here: but not much in the way of knowledge.</p>
<p>. . . As I lay in bed this morning, half dozing, I walked in 
imagination all the way from Tenby to Freestone by the road I 
know so well: by the water-mill, by Gumfreston, Ivy tower, and 
through the gates, and the long road that leads to Carew.</p>
<p>Now for the poet Carew:</p>
<blockquote><p>1.</p>
<p>Ask me no more where Jove bestows,<br />
When June is past, the fading rose:<br />
For in your beauty&rsquo;s orient deep,<br />
The flowers, as in their causes, sleep.</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>Ask me no more whither do stray<br />
The golden atoms of the day:<br />
<!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
13</span>For in pure love did Heav&rsquo;n prepare<br />
Those powders to enrich your hair.</p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>Ask me no more whither doth haste<br />
The nightingale when June is past:<br />
For in your sweet dividing throat<br />
She winters, and keeps warm her note.</p>
<p>4.</p>
<p>Ask me no more where those stars light<br />
That downward fall at dead of night:<br />
For in your eyes they sit, and there<br />
Fixed become, as in their sphere.</p>
<p>5.</p>
<p>Ask me no more if east or west<br />
The ph&oelig;nix builds her spicy nest:<br />
For unto you at last she flies,<br />
And in your fragrant bosom dies.</p>

<p>These lines are exaggerated, as all in Charles&rsquo;s time, 
but very beautiful. . . .</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Allen</span>,</p>
<p>The first thing I do in answering your letter is to tell you 
that I am angry at your saying that your conscience pricks you 
for not having written to me before.&nbsp; I am of that superior 
race of men, that are quite content to hear themselves talk, and 
read their own writing.&nbsp; But, in seriousness, I have such 
love of you, and of myself, that once every week, at least, I 
feel spurred on by a sort of gathering up of feelings <!-- page 
14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>to 
vent myself in a letter upon you: but if once I hear you say that
it makes your conscience thus uneasy till you answer, I shall 
give it up.&nbsp; Upon my word I tell you, that I do not in the 
least require it.&nbsp; You, who do not love writing, cannot 
think that any one else does: but I am sorry to say that I have a
very young-lady-like partiality to writing to those that I love. 
. . .&nbsp; I have been reading Shakespeare&rsquo;s Sonnets: and 
I believe I am unprejudiced when I say, I had but half an idea of
him, Demigod as he seemed before, till I read them 
carefully.&nbsp; How can Hazlitt call Warton&rsquo;s the finest 
sonnets?&nbsp; There is the air of pedantry and labour in 
his.&nbsp; But Shakespeare&rsquo;s are perfectly simple, and have
the very essence of tenderness that is only to be found in the 
best parts of his Romeo and Juliet besides.&nbsp; I have truly 
been lapped in these Sonnets for some time: they seem all stuck 
about my heart, like the ballads that used to be on the walls of 
London.&nbsp; I have put a great many into my Paradise, giving 
each a fair white sheet for himself: there being nothing worthy 
to be in the same page.&nbsp; I could talk for an hour about 
them: but it is not fit in a letter. . . .</p>
<p>I shall tell you of myself, that I have been better since I 
wrote to you.&nbsp; Mazzinghi <a name="citation14"></a><a 
href="#footnote14" class="citation">[14]</a> tells me that 
November weather breeds Blue Devils&mdash;so that there is a 
French proverb, &lsquo;In October, de Englishman <!-- page 
15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>shoot
de pheasant: in November he shoot himself.&rsquo;&nbsp; This I 
suppose is the case with me: so away with November, as soon as 
may be.&nbsp; &lsquo;Canst thou my Clora&rsquo; is being put in 
proper musical trim: and I will write it out for you when all is 
right.&nbsp; I am sorry you are getting so musical: and if I take
your advice about so big a thing as Christianity, take you mine 
about music.&nbsp; I am sure that this pleasure of music grows so
on people, that many of the hours that you would have devoted to 
Jeremy Taylor, etc. will be melted down into tunes, and the idle 
train of thought that music puts us into.&nbsp; I fancy I have 
discovered the true philosophy of this: but I think you must have
heard me enlarge.&nbsp; Therefore &lsquo;satis.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I have gabbled on so long that there is scarce room for my 
quotation.&nbsp; But it shall come though in a shapeless manner, 
for the sake of room.&nbsp; Have you got in your Christian Poet, 
a poem by Sir H. Wotton&mdash;&lsquo;How happy is he born or 
taught, that serveth not another&rsquo;s will&rsquo;?&nbsp; It is
very beautiful, and fit for a Paradise of any kind.&nbsp; Here 
are some lines from old Lily, which your ear will put in the 
proper metre.&nbsp; It gives a fine description of a fellow 
walking in Spring, and looking here and there, and pricking up 
his ears, as different birds sing.&nbsp; &lsquo;What bird so 
sings, but doth so wail?&nbsp; Oh! &rsquo;tis the ravished 
nightingale: &ldquo;Jug, jug, jug, jug, terue,&rdquo; she cries, 
and still her woes at midnight rise.&nbsp; Brave prick-song! who 
is&rsquo;t now we hear?&nbsp; It is the lark so shrill and clear:
against heaven&rsquo;s gate he claps his wings, the morn not 
waking <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>till he sings.&nbsp; Hark, too, with 
what a pretty note poor Robin Redbreast tunes his throat: Hark 
how the jolly cuckoos sing &ldquo;Cuckoo&rdquo; to welcome in the
Spring: &ldquo;Cuckoo&rdquo; to welcome in the 
Spring.&rsquo;&nbsp; This is very English, and pleasant, I think:
and so I hope you will.&nbsp; I could have sent you many a more 
sentimental thing, but nothing better.&nbsp; I admit nothing into
my Paradise, but such as breathe content, and virtue: I count 
&lsquo;Back and syde&rsquo; to breathe both of these, with a 
little good drink over.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday</i> [28 <i>Nov.</i> 1832].</p>
<p>P.S.&nbsp; I sealed up my letter yesterday, forgetting to 
finish.&nbsp; I write thus soon &lsquo;becase I gets a 
frank.&rsquo;&nbsp; You shall benefit by another bit of 
poetry.&nbsp; I do not admit it into my Paradise, being too 
gloomy: but it will please both of us.&nbsp; It is the prototype 
of the Pensieroso.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence all you vain delights!<br 
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; As short as are the nights<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherein you spend your folly!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nought in this life sweet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If man were wise to see &rsquo;t,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But only melancholy;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh sweetest melancholy!<br />
Welcome folded arms, and fixed eyes,<br />
A sigh, that piercing mortifies,<br />
A look that&rsquo;s fastened to the ground,<br />
A tongue chain&rsquo;d up without a sound!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fountain heads, and pathless gloves,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Places which pale passion loves!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>Moonlight walks, when all the 
fowls<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are warmly hous&rsquo;d, save bats and owls!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A midnight dell, a passing groan!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; These are the sounds we feed upon;<br />
Then stretch our bones in a still gloomy valley;<br />
Nothing&rsquo;s so dainty sweet as [lovely] melancholy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(From the <i>Nice Valour</i>, <i>or the Passionate Madman</i>,
by Fletcher.)</p>
<p>I think these lines are quite of the finest order, and have a 
more headlong melancholy than Milton&rsquo;s, which are 
distinctly copied from these, as you must confess.&nbsp; And now 
this is a very long letter, and the best thing you can do when 
you get to the end, is to Da Capo, and read what I ordered you 
about answering.&nbsp; My dear fellow, it is a great pleasure to 
me to write to you; and to write out these dear poems. . .

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Allen</span>,</p>
<p>You can hardly have got through my last letter by this 
time.&nbsp; I hope you liked the verses I sent you.&nbsp; The 
news of this week is that Thackeray has come to London, but is 
going to leave it again for Devonshire directly.&nbsp; He came 
very opportunely to divert my Blue Devils: notwithstanding, we do
not see very much of each other: and he has now so many friends 
(especially the Bullers) that he has no such wish for my 
society.&nbsp; He is as full of good humour and kindness as 
ever.&nbsp; The next news is that a new volume of Tennyson is 
out: containing nothing more <!-- page 18--><a 
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>than you have
in MS. except one or two things not worth having. . . .</p>
<p>When you write back (of which there is no hurry) send me an 
account that you and your Brother were once telling me at 
Bosherston, of three Generals condemned to die after the siege of
Pembroke in Cromwell&rsquo;s time: and of the lot being brought 
by a little child.&nbsp; Give me their names, etc. (if you can) 
pretty circumstantially: or else, tell me where I can find some 
notice of it. . . .</p>
<p>I have been poring over Wordsworth lately: which has had much 
effect in bettering my Blue Devils: for his philosophy does not 
abjure melancholy, but puts a pleasant countenance upon it, and 
connects it with humanity.&nbsp; It is very well, if the 
sensibility that makes us fearful of ourselves is diverted to 
become a cause of sympathy and interest with Nature and mankind: 
and this I think Wordsworth tends to do.&nbsp; I think I told you
of Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets before: I cannot tell you what 
sweetness I find in them.</p>
<blockquote><p>So by Shakespeare&rsquo;s Sonnets roasted, and 
Wordsworth&rsquo;s poems basted,<br />
My heart will be well toasted, and excellently tasted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This beautiful couplet must delight you, I think.&nbsp; I will
also give you the two last verses about Clora: though it is more 
complete and better without them: strange to say.&nbsp; You must 
have the goodness to repeat those you know over first, and then 
fall upon these: for there is a sort of reasoning in them, which 
<!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
19</span>requires proper order, as much as a proposition of 
Euclid.&nbsp; The first of them is not to my liking, but it is 
too much trouble about a little thing to work it into a 
better.&nbsp; You have the two first stanzas <a 
name="citation19"></a><a href="#footnote19" 
class="citation">[19]</a>&mdash;&ldquo;ergo&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>3.</p>
<p>Nothing can utterly die:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Music aloft upspringing<br />
Turns to pure atoms of sky<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each golden note of thy singing:<br />
And that to which morning did listen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At eve in a rainbow may glisten.</p>
<p>4.</p>
<p>Beauty, when laid in the grave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Feedeth the lily beside her:<br />
Therefore the soul cannot have<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Station or honour denied her:<br />
She will not better her essence,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But wear a crown in God&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Q.E.D.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
20</span>And I think there is quite enough of Clora and her 
music.&nbsp; I am hunting about the town for an ancient drinking 
cup, which I may use when I am in my house, in quality of 
housekeeper.&nbsp; Have the goodness to make my remembrances to 
all at that most pleasant house Freestone: I am quite serious in 
telling you how it is by far the pleasantest family I ever was 
among.</p>
<p>My sister is far better.&nbsp; We walk very much and see such 
sights as the town affords.&nbsp; To-day I have bought a little 
terrier to keep me company.&nbsp; You will think this is from my 
reading of Wordsworth: but if that were my cue, I should go no 
further than keeping a primrose in a pot for society.&nbsp; 
Farewell, dear Allen.&nbsp; I am astonished to find myself 
writing a very long letter once a week to you: but it is next to 
talking to you: and after having seen you so much this summer, I 
cannot break off suddenly.</p>
<p>I am your most affectionate friend,</p>

<p>. . . I am fearful to boast, lest I should lose what I boast 
of: but I think I have achieved a victory over my evil spirits 
here: for they have full opportunity to come, and I often observe
their approaches, but hitherto I have managed to keep them 
off.&nbsp; Lord Bacon&rsquo;s Essay on Friendship is wonderful 
for its truth: and I often feel its truth.&nbsp; He says that 
with a Friend &lsquo;a man <i>tosseth</i> his thoughts,&rsquo; an
admirable saying, which one can understand, but not express 
otherwise.&nbsp; But I feel that, being alone, one&rsquo;s 
thoughts and feelings, from want of communication, become heaped 
up and clotted together, as it were: and so lie like undigested 
food heavy upon the mind: but with a friend one <i>tosseth</i> 
them about, so that the air gets between them, and keeps them 
fresh and sweet.&nbsp; I know not from what metaphor Bacon took 
his &lsquo;tosseth,&rsquo; but it seems to me as if it was from 
the way <!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span

<p>. . . As to my history since I have seen you, there is little 
to tell.&nbsp; Divinity is not outraged by your not addressing me
as a Reverend&mdash;I not being one.&nbsp; I am a very lazy 
fellow, who do nothing: and this I have been doing in different 
places ever since I saw you last.&nbsp; I have not been well for 
the last week: for I am at present rather liable to be overset by
any weariness (and where can any be found that can match the 
effect of two Oratorios?), since for the last three months I have
lived on vegetables&mdash;that is, I have given up meat.&nbsp; 
When I was talking of this to Vipan, he told me that you had once
tried it, and given it up.&nbsp; I shall hear your account of its
effect <!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>on you.&nbsp; The truth is, that mine
is the wrong time of life to begin a change of that kind: it is 
either too early, or too late.&nbsp; But I have no doubt at all 
of the advantage of giving up meat: I find already much good from
it, in lightness and airiness of head, whereas I was always 
before clouded and more or less morbid after meat.&nbsp; The loss
of strength is to be expected: I shall keep on and see if that 
also will turn, and change into strength.&nbsp; I have almost 
Utopian notions about <i>vegetable diet</i>, begging pardon for 
making use of such a vile, Cheltenhamic, phrase.&nbsp; Why do you
not bring up your children to it?&nbsp; To be sure, the chances 
are, that, after guarding their vegetable morals for years, they 
would be seduced by some roast partridge with bread sauce, and 
become ungodly.&nbsp; This actually happened to the son of a Dr. 
Newton who wrote a book <a name="citation23"></a><a

his children to it&mdash;but all such things I will tell you when

<p>. . . As to myself, and my diet, about which you give such 
excellent advice: I am still determined to give the diet I have 
proposed a good trial: a year&rsquo;s trial.&nbsp; I agree with 
you about vegetables, and soups: but my diet is chiefly 
<i>bread</i>: which is only a little less nourishing than flesh: 
and, being compact, and baked, and dry, has none of the washy, 
diluent effects of green vegetables.&nbsp; I scarcely ever touch 
the latter: but only pears, apples, etc.&nbsp; I have found no 
benefit yet; except, as I think, in more lightness of spirits: 
which is a great good.&nbsp; But I shall see in time.</p>
<p>I am living in London in the quarter of the town which I have

Spedding is here: taking lessons of drawing, before he goes for 
good into Cumberland: whither, for my sake and that of all his 
friends, I wish he never would go: for there are few such men, as
far [as] I know.&nbsp; He and I have been theatricalizing 
lately.&nbsp; We saw an awful Hamlet the other night&mdash;a Mr. 
Serle&mdash;and a very good Wolsey, in Macready: and a very bad 
Queen Catherine, in Mrs. Sloman, whom you must remember.&nbsp; I 
am going to-night to see Macready in <!-- page 25--><a 
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>Macbeth: I 
have seen him before in it: and I go for the sake of his two last
acts, which are amazingly fine, I think. . . .&nbsp; I am close 
to the British Museum, in which I take great pleasure in reading 
in my rambling way.&nbsp; I hear of Kemble lately that he has 
been making some discoveries in Anglo-Saxon MSS. at Cambridge 
that, they say, are important to the interests of the church: and
there is talk of publishing them, I believe.&nbsp; He is a 
strange fellow for that fiery industry of his: and, I am sure, 
deserves some steady recompense.</p>
<p>Tennyson has been in town for some time: he has been making 
fresh poems, which are finer, they say, than any he has 
done.&nbsp; But I believe he is chiefly meditating on the purging
and subliming of what he has already done: and repents that he 
has published at all yet.&nbsp; It is fine to see how in each 
succeeding poem the smaller ornaments and fancies drop away, and 
leave the grand ideas single. . . .</p>
<p>I have lately bought a little pamphlet which is very difficult
to be got, called The Songs of Innocence, written and adorned 
with drawings by W. Blake (if you know his name) who was quite 
mad, but of a madness that was really the elements of great 
genius ill-sorted: in fact, a genius with a screw loose, as we 
used to say.&nbsp; I shall shew you this book when I see you: to 
me there is particular interest in this man&rsquo;s writing and 
drawing, from the strangeness of the constitution of his 
mind.&nbsp; He was a man that used to see visions: and make 
drawings and paintings <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Donne</span>,</p>
<p>Your book I got, and read through all that seemed to concern 
me the first day.&nbsp; I have doubted whether it would be most 
considerate to return you thanks for it, making you pay for a 
letter: or to leave you thankless, with a shilling more in your 
pocket.&nbsp; You see I have taken the latter [? former], and God
forgive me for it.&nbsp; The book is a good one, I think, as any 
book is, that notes down facts alone, especially about 
health.&nbsp; I wish we had diaries of the lives of half the 
unknown men that have lived.&nbsp; Like all other men who have 
got a theory into their heads, I can only see things in the light
of that theory; and whatever is brought to me to convince me to 
the contrary is only wrought and tortured to my view of the 
question.&nbsp; This lasts till a reaction is brought about by 
some of the usual means: as time, and love of novelty, etc.&nbsp;
I am still very obstinate and persist in my practices.&nbsp; I do
not think Stark is an instance of vegetable diet: consider how 
many things he tried grossly animal: lard, and butter, and fat: 
besides thwarting Nature in every way by eating when he wanted 
not to eat, and the contrary.&nbsp; Besides the <!-- page 27--><a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>editor says 
in the preface that he thinks his death was brought about as much
by vexation as by the course of his diet: but I suppose the truth
is that vexation could not have had so strong hold except upon a 
weakened body.&nbsp; However, altogether I do not at all admit 
Stark to be any instance: to be set up like a scarecrow to 
frighten us from the corn, etc.&nbsp; Last night I went to hear a
man lecture at Owen of Lanark&rsquo;s establishment (where I had 
never been before), and the subject happened to be about 
Vegetable Diet: but it was only the termination of a former 
lecture, so that I suppose all the good arguments (if there were 
any) were gone before.&nbsp; Do you know anything of a book by a 
Doctor Lamb upon this subject?&nbsp; I do not feel it to be 
disgusting to talk of myself upon this subject, because I think 
there is great interest in the subject itself.&nbsp; So I shall 
say that I am just now very well: in fine spirits.&nbsp; I have 
only eaten meat once for many weeks: and that was at a party 
where I did not like to be singled out.&nbsp; Neither have I 
tasted wine, except two or three times.&nbsp; If I fail at last I
shall think it a very great bore: but assuredly the first cut of 
a leg of mutton will be some consolation for my wounded 
judgement: that first cut is a fine thing.&nbsp; So much for 
this. . . .&nbsp; Have you heard that Arthur Malkin is to be 
married? to a Miss Carr, with what Addison might call a pleasing 
fortune: or perhaps Nicholas Rowe.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sweet, pleasing 
friendship, etc. etc.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Malkin is in high spirits
about it, I hear: and I am very glad indeed.&nbsp; God send that 
<!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
28</span>you have not heard this before: for a man likes to be 
the first teller of a pretty piece of news.&nbsp; Spedding and I 
went to see Macready in Hamlet the other night: with which he was
pretty well content, but not wholly.&nbsp; For my part, I have 
given up deciding on how Hamlet should be played: or rather have 
decided it shouldn&rsquo;t be played at all.&nbsp; I take 
pleasure in reading things I don&rsquo;t wholly understand; just 
as the old women like sermons: I think it is of a piece with an 
admiration of all Nature around us.&nbsp; I think there is a 
greater charm in the half meanings and glimpses of meaning that 
come in through Blake&rsquo;s wilder visions: though his 
difficulties arose from a very different source from 
Shakespeare&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But somewhat too much of this.&nbsp; I
suspect I have found out this as an useful solution, when I am 
asked the meaning of any thing that I am admiring, and 
don&rsquo;t know it.</p>

<p>I have been reading the Spectator since I have been here: and 
I like it very much.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think <!-- page

would make a nice book to publish all the papers about Sir Roger 
de Coverley alone, with illustrations by Thackeray?&nbsp; It is a
thing that is wanted: to bring that standard of the old English 
Gentleman forward out of the mass of little topics, and fashions,
that occupy the greater part of the Spectator.&nbsp; Thackeray 
has illustrated my Undine in about fourteen little coloured 
drawings&mdash;very nicely. . . .</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Allen</span>,</p>
<p>I have really nothing to say, and I am ashamed to be sending 
this third letter all the way from here to Pembrokeshire for no 
earthly purpose: but I have just received yours: and you will 
know how very welcome all your letters are to me when you see how
the perusal of this one has excited me to such an instant 
reply.&nbsp; It has indeed been a long time coming: but it is all
the more delicious.&nbsp; Perhaps you can&rsquo;t imagine how 
wistfully I have looked for it: how, <!-- page 30--><a 
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>after a walk,
my eyes have turned to the table, on coming into the room, to see
it.&nbsp; Sometimes I have been tempted to be angry with you: but
then I thought that I was sure you would come a hundred miles to 
serve me, though you were too lazy to sit down to a letter.&nbsp;
I suppose that people who are engaged in serious ways of life, 
and are of well filled minds, don&rsquo;t think much about the 
interchange of letters with any anxiety: but I am an idle fellow,
of a very ladylike turn of sentiment: and my friendships are more
like loves, I think.&nbsp; Your letter found me reading the Merry
Wives of Windsor too: I had been laughing aloud to myself: think 
of what another coat of happiness came over my former good 
mood.&nbsp; You are a dear good fellow, and I love you with all 
my heart and soul.&nbsp; The truth is I was anxious about this 
letter, as I really didn&rsquo;t know whether you were married or
not&mdash;or ill&mdash;I fancied you might be anything, or 
anywhere. . . .</p>
<p>As to reading I have not done much.&nbsp; I am going through 
the Spectator: which people nowadays think a poor book: but I 
honour it much.&nbsp; What a noble kind of Journal it was!&nbsp; 
There is certaintly a good deal of what may be called 
&lsquo;<i>pill</i>,&rsquo; but there is a great deal of wisdom, I
believe, only it is couched so simply that people can&rsquo;t 
believe it to be real absolute wisdom.&nbsp; The little book you 
speak of I will order and buy.&nbsp; I heard from Thackeray, who 
is just upon the point of going to France; indeed he may be there
by this time.&nbsp; I shall miss him much. . . .</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Donne</span>,</p>
<p>. . . I have been buying two Shakespeares, a second and third 
Folio&mdash;the second Folio pleases me much: and I can read him 
with a greater zest now.&nbsp; One had need of a big book to 
remember him by: for he is lost to the theatre: I saw Mr. 
Vandenhoff play Macbeth in a sad way a few nights ago: and such a
set of dirty ragamuffins as the rest were could not disgrace any 
country barn.&nbsp; Manfred I have missed by some chance: and I 
believe &lsquo;it was all for the best&rsquo; as pious people 
say.&nbsp; The Theatre is bare beyond anything I ever saw: and 
one begins to hope that it has touched the bottom of its badness,
and will rise again.&nbsp; I was looking the other day at Sir W. 
Davenant&rsquo;s alteration of Macbeth: who dies, saying, 
&lsquo;Farewell, vain world: and that which is vainest 
in&rsquo;t, Ambition!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Edgeworth, whom I think you remember at Cambridge, is come to 
live in town: and I see him often at the Museum.&nbsp; The want 
of books chiefly drove him from Italy: besides that he tells me 
he likes a <!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>constant change of scenes and ideas, 
and would be always about if he could.&nbsp; He is a very 
original man I think, and throws out much to be chewed and 
digested: but he is deficient in some elements that must combine 
to govern my love and admiration.&nbsp; He has much imagination 
of head, but none of heart: perhaps these are absurd 
distinctions: but I am no hand at these definitions.&nbsp; His 
great study is metaphysics: and Kant is his idol.&nbsp; He is 
rather without company in London, and I wish much to introduce 
him to such men as I know: but most of your Apostolic party who 
could best exchange ideas with him are not in town.&nbsp; He is 
full of his subjects, and only wants opponents to tilt at. . .

<p>The life of Coleridge <a name="citation32"></a><a

unsatisfactory thing: I believe that everybody thinks so.&nbsp; 
You seem to think that it is purposely unsatisfactory, or rather 
dissatisfactory: but it seems to me to proceed from a kind of 
enervation in De Quincey.&nbsp; However, I don&rsquo;t know how 
he supports himself in other writings. . . .</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Allen</span>,</p>
<p>I think that the fatal two months have elapsed, by which a 
letter shall become due to me from <!-- page 33--><a 
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>you.&nbsp; 
Ask Mrs. Allen if this is not so.&nbsp; Mind, I don&rsquo;t speak
this upbraidingly, because I know that you didn&rsquo;t know 
where I was.&nbsp; I will tell you all about this by 
degrees.&nbsp; In the first place, I staid at Mirehouse till the 
beginning of May, and then, going homeward, spent a week at 
Ambleside, which, perhaps you don&rsquo;t know, is on the shores 
of Winandermere.&nbsp; It was very pleasant there: though it was 
to be wished that the weather had been a little better.&nbsp; I 
have scarce done anything since I saw you but abuse the weather: 
but these four last days have made amends for all: and are, I 
hope, the beginning of summer at last.&nbsp; Alfred Tennyson 
staid with me at Ambleside: Spedding was forced to go home, till 
the last two days of my stay there.&nbsp; I will say no more of 
Tennyson than that the more I have seen of him, the more cause I 
have to think him great.&nbsp; His little humours and 
grumpinesses were so droll, that I was always laughing: and was 
often put in mind (strange to say) of my little unknown friend, 
Undine&mdash;I must however say, further, that I felt what 
Charles Lamb describes, a sense of depression at times from the 
overshadowing of a so much more lofty intellect than my own: this
(though it may seem vain to say so) I never experienced before, 
though I have often been with much greater intellects: but I 
could not be mistaken in the universality of his mind; and 
perhaps I have received some benefit in the now more distinct 
consciousness of my dwarfishness.&nbsp; I think that you should 
keep all this to yourself, my dear Allen: I <!-- page 34--><a 
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>mean, that it
is only to you that I would write so freely about myself.&nbsp; 
You know most of my secrets, and I am not afraid of entrusting 
even my vanities to so true a man. . . .</p>
<p>Pray, do not forget to say how the Freestone party are.&nbsp; 
My heart jumped to them, when I read in a guide book at 
Ambleside, that from Scawfell (a mountain in Westmoreland) you 
could see Snowdon.&nbsp; Perhaps you will not see the chain of 
ideas: but I suppose there was one, else I don&rsquo;t know how 
it was that I tumbled, as it were, from the very summit of 
Scawfell, upon the threshold of Freestone.&nbsp; The mind soon 
traverses Wales.&nbsp; I have not been reading very 
much&mdash;(as if you ever expected that I did!)&mdash;but I 
mean, not very much for me&mdash;some Dante, by the aid of a 
Dictionary: and some Milton&mdash;and some Wordsworth&mdash;and 
some Selections from Jeremy Taylor, Barrow, etc., compiled by 
Basil Montagu&mdash;of course you know the book: it is published 
by Pickering.&nbsp; I do not think that it is very well done: but
it has served to delight, and, I think, to instruct me 
much.&nbsp; Do you know South?&nbsp; He must be very great, I 
think.&nbsp; It seems to me that our old Divines will hereafter 
be considered our Classics&mdash;(in Prose, I mean)&mdash;I am 
not aware that any other nations have such books.&nbsp; A single 
selection from Jeremy Taylor is fine: but it requires a skilful 
hand to put many detached bits from him together: for a common 
editor only picks out the flowery, metaphorical, morsels: and so 
rather cloys: and gives quite a <!-- page 35--><a 
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>wrong 
estimate of the Author, to those who had no previous acquaintance
with him: for, rich as Taylor&rsquo;s illustrations, and 
grotesque as his images, are, no one keeps a grander proportion: 
he never huddles illustration upon the matter so as to overlay 
it, nor crowds images too thick together: which these Selections 
might make one unacquainted with him to suppose.&nbsp; This is 
always the fault of Selections: but Taylor is particularly liable
to injury on this score.&nbsp; What a man he is!&nbsp; He has 
such a knowledge of the nature of man, and such powers of 
expressing its properties, that I sometimes feel as if he had had
some exact counterpart of my own individual character under his 
eye, when he lays open the depths of the heart, or traces some 
sin to its root.&nbsp; The eye of his portrait expresses this 
keen intuition: and I think I should less like to have stood with
a lie on my tongue before him, than before any other I know of. .
. .</p>
<p>I beg you to give my best remembrances to your lady, who may 
be always sure that in all I wish of well for you, she is

<p style="text-align: right"><span

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Allen</span>,</p>
<p>. . . My brother John&rsquo;s wife, always delicate, has had 
an attack this year, which she can never get over: and while we 
are all living in this house cheerfully, she lives in separate 
rooms, can scarcely speak to us, <!-- page 36--><a 
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>or see us: 
and bears upon her cheek the marks of death.&nbsp; She has shewn 
great Christian dignity all through her sickness: was the only 
cheerful person when they supposed she could not live: and is now
very composed and happy.&nbsp; You say sometimes how like things 
are to dreams: or, as I think, to the shifting scenes of a 
play.&nbsp; So does this place seem to me.&nbsp; All our family, 
except my mother, are collected here: all my brothers and 
sisters, with their wives, husbands, and children: sitting at 
different occupations, or wandering about the grounds and 
gardens, discoursing each their separate concerns, but all united
into one whole.&nbsp; The weather is delightful: and when I see 
them passing to and fro, and hear their voices, it is like scenes
of a play.&nbsp; I came here only yesterday.&nbsp; I have much to
tell you of: I mean, much in my small way: I will keep all till I
see you, for I don&rsquo;t know with what to begin in a letter. .
. .</p>
<p>Edgeworth introduced me to his wife and sister-in-law, who are
very handsome Spanish ladies, seemingly of excellent sense.&nbsp;
The wife is the gentler, and more feminine: and the sister more 
regularly handsome, and vivacious.&nbsp; I think that he is a 
very remarkable man: and I like him more the more I see of 
him.</p>
<p>What you say of Tennyson and Wordsworth is not, I think, 
wholly just.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think that a man can turn 
himself so directly to the service of morality, unless naturally 
inclined: I think Wordsworth&rsquo;s is a natural bias that 
way.&nbsp; Besides, one must have labourers of different kinds in
the vineyard of <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>morality, which I certainly look up 
to as the chief object of our cultivation: Wordsworth is first in
the craft: but Tennyson does no little by raising and filling the
brain with noble images and thoughts, which, if they do not 
direct us to our duty, purify and cleanse us from mean and 
vicious objects, and so prepare and fit us for the reception of 
the higher philosophy.&nbsp; A man might forsake a drunken party 
to read Byron&rsquo;s Corsair: and Byron&rsquo;s Corsair for 
Shelley&rsquo;s Alastor: and the Alastor for the Dream of Fair 
Women or the Palace of Art: and then I won&rsquo;t say that he 
would forsake these two last for anything of Wordsworth&rsquo;s, 
but his mind would be sufficiently refined and spiritualised to 
admit Wordsworth, and profit by him: and he might keep all the 
former imaginations as so many pictures, or pieces of music, in 
his mind.&nbsp; But I think that you will see Tennyson acquire 
all that at present you miss: when he has <i>felt</i> life, he 
will not die fruitless of instruction to man as he is.&nbsp; But 
I dislike this kind of criticism, especially in a letter.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know any one who has thought out any thing so little 
as I have.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see to any end, and should keep 
silent till I have got a little more, and that little better 
arranged.</p>
<p>I am sorry that all this page is filled with this botheration,
when I have a thousand truer and better things that I want to 
talk to you about.&nbsp; I will write to you again soon.&nbsp; If
you please to write (but consider it no call upon you, for the 
letter I have just got from you is a stock that will last me in 
comfort this <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>long while) I shall be at Wherstead 
all July&mdash;after that I know not where, but probably in 
Suffolk.&nbsp; Farewell, my best of fellows: there is no use 
saying how much I wish that all your sorrow will be turned to 
hope, and all your hope to joy.&nbsp; As far as we men can judge,
you are worthy of all earthly happiness.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>At the end of July, 1835, FitzGerald writes from Wherstead to 
Thackeray, who was then in Paris studying art:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;My Father is determined to inhabit an empty
house of his about fourteen miles off: <a 
name="citation38"></a><a href="#footnote38" 
class="citation">[38]</a> and we are very sorry to leave this 
really beautiful place.&nbsp; The other house has no great 
merit.&nbsp; So there is nothing now but packing up sofas, and 
pictures, and so on.&nbsp; I rather think that I shall be hanging
about this part of the world all the winter: for my two sisters 
are about to inhabit this new house alone, and I cannot but wish 
to add my company to them now and then. . . .</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear boy, God bless thee a thousand times 
over!&nbsp; When are we to see thee?&nbsp; How long are you going
to be at Paris?&nbsp; What have you been doing?&nbsp; The drawing
you sent me was very pretty.&nbsp; So you don&rsquo;t like 
Raphael!&nbsp; Well, I am his inveterate admirer: and say, with 
as little affectation as I can, that his worst scrap fills my 
head more than all Rubens and Paul Veronese 
together&mdash;&ldquo;the mind, the mind, Master 
Shallow!&rdquo;&nbsp; You think this cant, I dare <!-- page 
39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>say: 
but I say it truly, indeed.&nbsp; Raphael&rsquo;s are the only 
pictures that cannot be described: no one can get words to 
describe their perfection.&nbsp; Next to him, I retreat to the 
Gothic imagination, and love the mysteries of old chairs, Sir 
Rogers, etc. in which thou, my dear boy, art and shalt be a 
Raphael.&nbsp; To depict the true old English gentleman, is as 
great a work as to depict a Saint John, and I think in my heart I
would rather have the former than the latter.&nbsp; There are 
plenty of pictures in London&mdash;some good Water-colours by 
Lewis&mdash;Spanish things.&nbsp; Two or three very vulgar 
portraits by Wilkie, at the Exhibition: and a big one of 
Columbus, half good, and half bad.&nbsp; There is always a spice 
of vulgarity about Wilkie.&nbsp; There is an Eastlake, but I 
missed it.&nbsp; Etty has boats full of naked backs as usual: but
what they mean, I didn&rsquo;t stop to enquire.&nbsp; He has one 
picture, however, of the Bridge of Sighs in Venice, which is 
sublime: though I believe nobody saw it, or thought about it but 
myself.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About the same time that FitzGerald went to Boulge, George 
Crabbe, the Poet&rsquo;s eldest son and biographer, was appointed
to the Vicarage of the adjoining parish of Bredfield, and a 
friendship sprang up between them which was only terminated by 
Mr. Crabbe&rsquo;s death in 1857.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what has come over me of late, that I have 
not written to you, nor any body else for several months.&nbsp; I
am sure it is not from any decrease of affection towards 
you.&nbsp; I now begin a letter merely on the score of wanting 
one from you: to let me know how you are; and Mrs. Allen too, 
especially.&nbsp; I hope to hear good news of her.&nbsp; Many 
things may have happened to you since I saw you: you may be a

since I saw you.&nbsp; We are come to settle at this place: and I
have been enjoying capital health in my old native air.&nbsp; I 
meant to have come to London for the winter: but my sisters are 
here, and I do not like to leave them.&nbsp; This parish is a 
very small one: it scarce contains fifty people: but that next to
it, Bredfield, has more than four hundred: and some very poor 
indeed.&nbsp; We hope to be of some use: but the new Poor Laws

much depends upon the issue of this measure!&nbsp; I am no 
politician: but I fear that no political measure will ever adjust
matters well between rich and poor. . . .</p>
<p>I have just read Southey&rsquo;s Life of Cowper; that is <!-- 
page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
41</span>to say, the first Volume.&nbsp; It is not a book to be 
read by every man at the fall of the leaf.&nbsp; It is a fearful 
book.&nbsp; Have you read it?&nbsp; Southey hits hard at Newton 
in the dark; which will give offence to many people: but I 
perfectly agree with him.&nbsp; At the same time, I think that 
Newton was a man of great power.&nbsp; Did you ever read his life
by himself?&nbsp; Pray do, if you have not.&nbsp; His journal to 
his wife, written at sea, contains some of the most beautiful 
things I ever read: fine feeling in very fine English. . . .</p>
<p>Pray do write to me: a few lines soon are better than a 
three-decker a month hence: for I really want to know where and 
how you are: and so be a good boy for once in your life.&nbsp; 
Ever yours lovingly,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Donne</span>,</p>
<p>. . . As to the sponsorship, I was sure that you and Mrs. 
Donne would receive my apology as I meant it.&nbsp; Indeed I wish
with you that people would speak their minds more sincerely than 
it is the custom to do; and recoin some of the every day 
compliments into a simpler form: but this is voted a stale 
subject, I believe.&nbsp; Anyhow, I will not preach to you who do
not err: not to mention that I cannot by any means set up myself 
as any model of this virtue: whatever you may say to the 
contrary.</p>
<p><!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
42</span>I have consulted my friend John Allen concerning your 
ancestor&rsquo;s sermons: he says that the book is scarce. . . 
.&nbsp; I think that you should be possessed of him by all means,
considering that you are his descendant.&nbsp; Allen read much of
him at the Museum, and has always spoken very highly of 
him.&nbsp; As to doctrine, I believe Jeremy Taylor has never been
quite blameless; but then he wrote many folios instead of 
Donne&rsquo;s one: and I cannot help agreeing with Bayle that one
of the disadvantages of much writing is, that a man is likely to 
contradict himself.&nbsp; If he does not <i>positively</i> do so,
he may <i>seem</i> to do so, by using different expressions for 
the same thing, which expressions many readers may construe 
diversely: and this is especially likely to be the case with so 
copious and metaphorical a writer as Jeremy.</p>
<p>According to the principles contained in page 1 of this letter
I will tell you that I thought the second volume of Southey <a 
name="citation42"></a><a href="#footnote42" 
class="citation">[42]</a> rather dull.&nbsp; But then I have only
read it once; and I think that one is naturally impatient of all 
matter that does not absolutely touch Cowper: I mean, at the 
first reading; when one wants to know all about him.&nbsp; I dare
say that afterwards I shall relish all the other relative matter,
and contemporary history, which seems indeed well done.&nbsp; I 
am glad that you are so content with the book.&nbsp; We were all 
talking the other night of Basil Montagu&rsquo;s new Life of 
Bacon&mdash;have you read it?&nbsp; It is said to be very 
elaborate and tedious.&nbsp; A good life of Bacon <!-- page 
43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>is 
much wanted.&nbsp; But perhaps it is as difficult to find a 
proper historian for him as for anyone that ever lived.&nbsp; But
enough of grave matters.&nbsp; I have been very little to the 
Play: Vandenhoff&rsquo;s Iago I did not see: for indeed what I 
saw of him in other characters did not constrain me to the 
theatre to see his Iago. . .</p>
<p>Spedding is just now furnishing chambers in Lincoln&rsquo;s 
Inn Fields: so that we may look on him as a fixture in 
London.&nbsp; He and I went to dine with Tennant at Blackheath 
last Thursday: there we met Edgeworth, who has got a large house 
at Eltham, and is lying in wait for pupils: I am afraid he will 
not find many.&nbsp; We passed a very delightful evening.&nbsp; 
Tennant is making interest for a school at Cambridge: <a

that I hear that Sterling <a name="citation43b"></a><a

an attack on his chest, which keeps him from preaching: and that 
Trench has been in London.&nbsp; Neither of these men do I know,

<p>I am very deep in my Aristophanes, and find the Edition I

his long words, and local allusions, make him difficult, so far

do not agree with you.&nbsp; I have read nothing else.&nbsp; What

<p>Another letter in so short a time will surprise you.&nbsp; My 
old Lady will be glad of a new edition of Jeremy Taylor, beside 
the old one.&nbsp; I remember you once gave me a very nice large 
duodecimo one: are these to be had, and cheap?&nbsp; It must have
a good type, to suit old eyes.&nbsp; When you are possessed of 
these and the other books I begged you to ask for (except the 
Bacon which is for myself) do me one favour more: which is to 
book them per Coach at the White Horse, Piccadilly, directed to 
Mrs. Schutz, Gillingham Hall, Beccles.&nbsp; I should not have 
troubled you again, but that she, poor lady, is anxious to 
possess the books soon, as she never looks forward to living 
through a year: and she finds that Jeremy Taylor sounds a good 
note of preparation for that last hour which she looks upon as 
drawing nigh.&nbsp; I myself think she will live much longer: as 
she is wonderfully healthy for her time of 
life&mdash;seventy-six. <a name="citation45"></a><a 
href="#footnote45" class="citation">[45]</a>&nbsp; Sometimes I 
talk to her about you: and she loves you by report.&nbsp; You 
never grudge any trouble for your friends: but as this is a 
little act of kindness for an old and noble lady, I <!-- page 
46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>shall
apologize no more for it.&nbsp; I will pay you all you disburse 
when I come to London.</p>
<p>I was made glad and sad last night in looking over some of 
your letters to me, ever since my stay at Tenby.&nbsp; I wonder 
within myself if we are changed since then.&nbsp; Do you remember
that day when we sat upon that rock that runs out into the sea, 
and looked down into the clear water below?&nbsp; I must go to 
Tenby one of these days, and walk that old walk to 
Freestone.&nbsp; How well I remember what a quiet delight it was 
to walk out and meet you, when you were coming to stay a week 
with me once at my lodgings. . . .</p>
<p>And now, Sir, when you next go to the British Museum, look for
a Poet named Vaughan.&nbsp; Do you know him?&nbsp; I read some 
fine sacred poems of his in a Collection of John Mitford&rsquo;s:
he selects them from a book of Vaughan&rsquo;s called 
&lsquo;Silex Scintillans,&rsquo; 1621.&nbsp; He seems to have 
great fancy and fervour and some deep thought.&nbsp; Yet many of 
the things are in the tricksy spirit of that time: but there is a
little Poem beginning &lsquo;They are all gone into a World of 
Light,&rsquo; etc., which shews him to be capable of much.&nbsp; 
Again farewell, my dear Allen: give my best remembrances to Mrs. 
Allen, who must think that I write to you as if you were still a

<p>Another commission in so short a time is rather too bad: but I
know not to whom I can apply but to yourself: for our bookseller 
here could not get me what I want, seeing that I don&rsquo;t 
exactly know myself.&nbsp; The book I want is an Athen&aelig;us, 
but the edition I know not: and therefore I apply to you who know

often as I may.&nbsp; My sisters are reading to me Lyell&rsquo;s 
Geology of an Evening: there is an admirable chapter illustrative
of human error and prejudice retarding the truth, which will 
apply to all sciences, I believe: and, if people would consider 
it, would be more valuable than the geological knowledge, though 
that is very valuable, I <!-- page 48--><a

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Allen</span>,</p>
<p>Have you done with my Doctor?&nbsp; If you have, will you send
him to me here: Boulge Hall, Woodbridge, per Shannon Coach?&nbsp;
You may book it at the Boar and Castle, Oxford Street, close by 
Hanway Passage.&nbsp; This is not far out of your beat.&nbsp; 
Perhaps I should not have sent for this book (it is Bernard 
Barton the Quaker who asks to read it) but that it gives me an 
excuse also to talk a little to you.&nbsp; Ah! I wish you were 
here to walk with me now that the warm weather is come at 
last.&nbsp; Things have been delayed but to be more welcome, and 
to burst forth twice as thick and beautiful.&nbsp; This is 
boasting however, and counting of the chickens before they are 
hatched: the East winds may again plunge us back into winter: but
the sunshine of this morning fills one&rsquo;s pores with 
jollity, as if one had taken laughing gas.&nbsp; Then my house is
getting on: the books are up in the bookshelves and do my heart 
good: then Stothard&rsquo;s Canterbury Pilgrims are over the 
fireplace: Shakespeare in a recess: how I wish you were here for 
a day or two!&nbsp; My sister is very well and cheerful and we 
have kept house very pleasantly together.&nbsp; My brother 
John&rsquo;s wife is, I fear, declining very fast: <!-- page 
49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>it is
very probable that I shall have to go and see her before long: 
though this is a visit I should gladly be spared.&nbsp; They say 
that her mind is in a very beautiful state of peacefulness.&nbsp;
She <i>may</i> rally in the summer: but the odds are much against
her.&nbsp; We shall lose a perfect Lady, in the complete sense of
the word, when she dies.</p>
<p>I have been doing very little since I have been here: having 
accomplished only a few Idylls of Theocritus, which harmonize 
with this opening of the fine weather.&nbsp; Is all this poor 
occupation for a man who has a soul to account for?&nbsp; You 
think so certainly.&nbsp; My dear Allen, you, with your 
accustomed humility, asked me if I did not think you changed when
I was last in London: never did I see man less so: indeed you 
stand on too sure a footing to change, I am persuaded.&nbsp; But 
you will not thank me for telling you these things: but I wish 
you to believe that I rejoice as much as ever in the thought of 
you, and feel confident that you will ever be to me the same best
of friends that you ever have been.&nbsp; I owe more to you than 
to all others put together.&nbsp; I am sure, for myself, that the
main difference in our opinions (considered so destructive to 
friendship by so many pious men) is a difference in the 
Understanding, not in the Heart: and though you may not agree 
entirely in this, I am confident that it will never separate you 
from me.</p>
<p>Mrs. Schutz is much delighted with the books you got for her: 
and still enquires if you hurt your <!-- page 50--><a

searching.&nbsp; This she does in all simplicity and 
kindness.&nbsp; She has been very ill all the winter: but I see 
by a letter I have just had from her that her mind is still 
cheerful and the same.&nbsp; The <i>mens sana in corpore sano</i>
of old age is most to be wondered at.</p>

<p>John, <a name="citation50b"></a><a href="#footnote50b"

hope take this letter and despatch it to you properly.&nbsp; I 
write more on account of this opportunity than of anything I have
to say: for I am very heavy indeed with a kind of Influenza, 
which has blocked up most of my senses, and put a wet blanket 
over my brains.&nbsp; This state of head has not been improved by
trying to get through a new book much in 
fashion&mdash;Carlyle&rsquo;s French Revolution&mdash;written in 
a German style.&nbsp; An Englishman writes of French Revolutions 
in a German style.&nbsp; People say the book is very deep: but it
appears to me that the meaning <i>seems</i> deep from lying under
mystical language.&nbsp; There is no repose, nor equable movement
in it: all cut up into short sentences half reflective, half 
narrative; so that one labours through it as vessels do through 
what is called a short sea&mdash;small, contrary going waves 
caused <!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>by shallows, and straits, and meeting
tides, etc.&nbsp; I like to sail before the wind over the surface
of an even-rolling eloquence, like that of Bacon or the Opium 
Eater.&nbsp; There is also pleasant fresh water sailing with such
writers as Addison; is there any <i>pond</i>-sailing in 
literature? that is, drowsy, slow, and of small compass?&nbsp; 
Perhaps we may say, some Sermons.&nbsp; But this is only 
conjecture.&nbsp; Certainly Jeremy Taylor rolls along as 
majestically as any of them.&nbsp; We have had Alfred Tennyson 
here; very droll, and very wayward: and much sitting up of nights
till two and three in the morning with pipes in our mouths: at 
which good hour we would get Alfred to give us some of his magic 
music, which he does between growling and smoking; and so to 
bed.&nbsp; All this has not cured my Influenza as you may 
imagine: but these hours shall be remembered long after the 
Influenza is forgotten.</p>
<p>I have bought scarce any new books or prints: and am not sorry
to see that I want so little more.&nbsp; One large purchase I 
have made however, the Biographie Universelle, 53 Octavo 
Volumes.&nbsp; It contains everything, and is the very best thing
of its kind, and so referred to by all historians, etc.&nbsp; 
Surely nothing is more pleasant than, when some name crosses one,
to go and get acquainted with the owner of the name: and this 
Biographie really has found places for people whom one would have
thought almost too small for so comprehensive a work&mdash;which 
sounds like a solecism, or Bull, does it not?</p>
<p><!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
52</span>Now I must finish my letter: and a very stupid one it 
is.&nbsp; Here is a sentence of Warburton&rsquo;s that, I think, 
is very wittily expressed: though why I put it in here is not 
very discoverable.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Church, like the Ark of Noah,
is worth saving: not for the sake of the unclean beasts that 
almost filled it, and probably made most noise and clamour in it,
but for the little corner of rationality, that was as much 
distressed by the stink within, as by the tempest 
without.&rsquo;&nbsp; Is it not good?&nbsp; It is out of his 
letters: <a name="citation52"></a><a href="#footnote52"

also the best thing in mine.</p>

<p>I have just come home after accompanying my Father and Lusia 
to their starting place in the City: they are off for Suffolk for
some days.&nbsp; I should have written to you by them: but I only
just now found your letter on the mantelpiece: there it has lain 
some days during which I have been ruralising in 
Bedfordshire.&nbsp; Delicious has it been there: such weather, 
such meadows, to enjoy: and the Ouse still wandering along at his
ease through pretty villages and vales of his own 
beautifying.&nbsp; I am much in love with <!-- page 53--><a 
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>Bedfordshire:
it beats our part of the world: and I am sure you would like 
it.&nbsp; But here I am come back to London for another three 
weeks I suppose. . . .</p>
<p>I should much like to see your Platonic Brother.&nbsp; By your
account he must have a very perfect mental organization: or, 
phrenologically speaking, he must be fully and equally furnished 
with the bumps of ideality and causality: which, as Bacon would 
say, are the two extreme poles on which the perfect &lsquo;sound 
and roundabout&rsquo; intellect is balanced.&nbsp; A great 
deficiency of the causality bump causes me to break short in a 
long discussion which I meant to have favoured you with on this 
subject.&nbsp; I hope to meet your Brother one of these days: and
to learn much from him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Guesses at Truth&rsquo; I 
know very well: the two Brothers are the Hares: one a fellow of 
Trinity College, Cambridge; the other Author of some Sermons 
which I think you had from me this winter.&nbsp; &lsquo;The 
Guesses&rsquo; are well worth reading; nay, buying: very 
ingenious, with a good deal of pedantry and <i>onesidedness</i> 
(do you know this German word?), which, I believe, chiefly comes 
from the Trinity Fellow, who was a great pedant.&nbsp; I have 
just read Mrs. Austin&rsquo;s Characteristics of Goethe: which I 
will bring for you when I come.&nbsp; It is well worth knowing 
something of the mind of certainly a great man, and who has had 
more effect on his age than any one else.&nbsp; There is 
something almost fearful in the energy of his intellect.&nbsp; I 
wish indeed you were in London to see all these pictures: I am 
sure their greatness <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>would not diminish your pleasure in 
your own small collection.&nbsp; Why should it?&nbsp; There is as
genuine a feeling of Nature in one of Nursey&rsquo;s sketches as 
in the Rubenses and Claudes here: and if that is evident, and 
serves to cherish and rekindle one&rsquo;s own sympathy with the 
world about one, the great end is accomplished.&nbsp; I do not 
know very much of Salvator: is he not rather a melodramatic 
painter?&nbsp; No doubt, very fine in his way.&nbsp; But Claude 
and the two Poussins are the great ideal painters of 
Landscape.&nbsp; Nature looks more stedfast in them than in other
painters: all is wrought up into a quietude and harmony that seem
eternal.&nbsp; This is also one of the mysterious charms in the 
Holy Families of Raffaelle and of the early painters before him: 
the faces of the Madonnas are beyond the discomposure of passion,
and their very draperies betoken an Elysian atmosphere where wind
never blew.&nbsp; The best painter of the unideal Christ is, I 
think, Rembrandt: as one may see in his picture at the National 
Gallery, and that most wonderful one of our Saviour and the 
Disciples at Emmaus in the Louvre: there they sit at supper as 
they might have sat.&nbsp; Rubens and the Venetian Painters did 
neither one thing nor the other: their Holy figures are neither 
ideal nor real: and it is incongruous to see one of Rubens&rsquo;
brawny boors dressed up in the ideal red and blue drapery with 
which the early Italians clothed their figures of Christ.&nbsp; 
But enough of all this.&nbsp; I have seen Trench&rsquo;s 
Sabbation, and like it much: how do you like those <!-- page 
55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
55</span>centuries of couplets, which are a German fashion?&nbsp;
They are very much in the style of Quarles&rsquo; Emblems, and 
other pithy epigrams of that time: only doubtless more 
artistically polished: perhaps profounder.&nbsp; There were some 
of the same kind in Blackwood some months ago.&nbsp; My paper is 
out: and I must again say Good Bye.</p>

<i>August</i> 28 [1838.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Allen</span>,</p>
<p>. . . When I left town I went into Bedfordshire and loitered 
about there and in Northamptonshire till ten days ago: when I 
came to join my sisters at this watering place on the Suffolk 
coast.&nbsp; I have been spending a very pleasant time; but the 
worst of it is that the happier I am with Browne the sorrier I am
to leave him.&nbsp; To put off this most evil day I have brought 
him out of Bedfordshire here: and here we are together in a 
pleasant lodging looking out upon the sea, teaching a great black
dog to fetch and carry, playing with our neighbour&rsquo;s 
children, doing the first five propositions of Euclid (which 
<i>I</i> am teaching him!), shooting gulls on the shore, going 
out in boats, etc.&nbsp; All this must have an end: and as usual 
my pleasure in his stay is proportionably darkened by the 
anticipation of his going, and go he must in a very few 
days.&nbsp; Well, Carlyle told us that we are not to expect to be
so happy.&nbsp; I have thought once or twice <!-- page 56--><a 
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>how equally 
happy I was with you by the seaside at Tenby.&nbsp; You and 
Browne (though in rather different ways) have certainly made me 
more happy than any men living.&nbsp; Sometimes I behave very ill
to him, and am much ashamed of myself: but enough of this.</p>
<p>I have been to see two shew places lately: Boughton in 
Northamptonshire, a seat of the Duke of Buccleugh&rsquo;s, of the
Versailles or Clare Hall style of building, in a very great park 
planted with the longest avenues I ever saw.&nbsp; But I thought 
the whole affair gloomy and deserted.&nbsp; There are some fine 
pictures: and two cartoons said to be by Raffaelle: of which one 
is the vision of Ezechiel&mdash;I could not judge of their 
genuineness.&nbsp; The other place I have seen is Woburn 
Abbey&mdash;the Duke of Bedford&rsquo;s&mdash;a fine place but 
not much to my taste either.&nbsp; There are very fine pictures 
there of all kinds&mdash;one room hung with brilliant 
Canalettis&mdash;and altogether the pictures are better arranged 
and hung than in any place I have seen.&nbsp; But these kind of 
places have not much character in them: an old Squire&rsquo;s 
gable-ended house is much more English and aristocratic to my 
mind.&nbsp; I wish you had been with me and Browne at an old seat
of Lord Dysart&rsquo;s, Helmingham in Suffolk, the other 
day.&nbsp; There is a portrait there of the present Lady Dysart 
in the prime of her beauty, by Sir Joshua.&nbsp; She is now 
95.</p>
<p>. . . I am reading Pindar now and then: I don&rsquo;t much 
care about him I must say: though I suppose <!-- page 57--><a 
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>he is the 
very best writer in the Poet Laureate style: that is, writing on 
occasion for so much money.&nbsp; I see great merits 
doubtless&mdash;a concise and simple way of saying great things, 
etc., but the subjects are not interesting enough to me.&nbsp; I 
suppose a good poet could have celebrated Dutch Sam <a

<p>I see in the last Atlas a notice of the first Concert of the 
Societ&agrave; Armonica&mdash;there were you to be found of 
course seated in black velvet waistcoat (for I hope you remember 
these are dress concerts) on one of the benches, grumbling at 
most of the music.&nbsp; You had a long symphony of 
Beethoven&rsquo;s in B flat&mdash;I forget how it goes, but 
doubtless there was much good in it.&nbsp; The overture to Egmont
is also a fine thing.&nbsp; The Atlas (which is the best weekly 
critic of Music and all other things that I know of) gives great 
&kappa;&upsilon;&delta;&omicron;&sigmaf; to the Societ&agrave; 
Armonica: especially this season, as the Directors seem 
determined to replace Donizetti and Mercadante by Mozart and 
Rossini, in the vocal <!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>department.&nbsp; A good change 
doubtless.&nbsp; I hear no music now: except that for the last 
week I have been staying with Spring Rice&rsquo;s mother in-law 
Mrs. Frere, <a name="citation58"></a><a href="#footnote58" 
class="citation">[58]</a> one of the finest judges of Music I 
know.&nbsp; She was a very fine singer: but her voice fails 
now.&nbsp; We used to look over the score of Don Giovanni 
together, and many a mystery and mastery of composition did she 
shew me in it.&nbsp; Now then there is enough of Music.&nbsp; I 
wish you would write me a letter, which you can do now and then 
if you will take it into your head, and let me know how you and 
my dear old Morton are, and whether you dine and smoke together 
as heretofore.&nbsp; If you won&rsquo;t write, tell him to do so:
or make up a letter between you.&nbsp; What new pictures are 
there to be seen?&nbsp; Have you settled yet whether spirit can 
exist separately from matter?&nbsp; Are you convinced of the 
truth of Murphy&rsquo;s Almanac this year?&nbsp; Have you learned
any more Astronomy?&nbsp; I live on in a very seedy way, reading 
occasionally in books which every one else has gone through at 
school: and what I do read is just in the same way as ladies 
work: to pass the time away.&nbsp; For little remains in my 
head.&nbsp; I dare say you think it very absurd that an idle man 
like me should poke about here in the country, when I might be in
London seeing my friends: but such is the humour of the 
beast.&nbsp; But it is not always to be the case: I shall see 
your good physiognomy one of these days, and smoke one of your 
cigars, and listen <!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>to Morton saying fine and wild 
things, &lsquo;startling the dull ear of night&rsquo; with 
paradoxes that perhaps are truisms in the world where spirits 
exist independent of matter.&nbsp; You two men have made great 
commotion in my mind, and left your marks upon it, I can tell 
you: more than most of the books I read.&nbsp; What is Alfred 
about, and where is he?&nbsp; Present my homage to him.&nbsp; 
Don&rsquo;t you rather rejoice in the pickle the King of the 
French finds himself in?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know why, but I have
a sneaking dislike of the old knave.&nbsp; How he must pine to 
summon up Talleyrand&rsquo;s Ghost, and what a Ghost it must be, 
wherever it is!</p>

<p>Some one from this house is going to London: and I will try 
and write you some lines now in half an hour before dinner: I am 
going out for the evening to my old lady who teaches me the names
of the stars, and other chaste information. <a

if I do not come to London (and I have no thought of going yet) 
and you will not write, there is likely to be an end of our 
communication: not by the way that I am never to go to London 
again: but not just yet.&nbsp; Here I live with tolerable 
content: perhaps with as much as most people arrive at, and what 
if one were properly grateful one would perhaps <!-- page 60--><a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>call perfect 
happiness.&nbsp; Here is a glorious sunshiny day: all the morning
I read about Nero in Tacitus lying at full length on a bench in 
the garden: a nightingale singing, and some red anemones eyeing 
the sun manfully not far off.&nbsp; A funny mixture all this: 
Nero, and the delicacy of Spring: all very human however.&nbsp; 
Then at half past one lunch on Cambridge cream cheese: then a 
ride over hill and dale: then spudding up some weeds from the 
grass: and then coming in, I sit down to write to you, my sister 
winding red worsted from the back of a chair, and the most 
delightful little girl in the world chattering incessantly.&nbsp;
So runs the world away.&nbsp; You think I live in Epicurean ease:
but this happens to be a jolly day: one isn&rsquo;t always well, 
or tolerably good, the weather is not always clear, nor 
nightingales singing, nor Tacitus full of pleasant 
atrocity.&nbsp; But such as life is, I believe I have got hold of
a good end of it. . . .&nbsp; Give my love to Thackeray from your
upper window across the street. <a name="citation60a"></a><a

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Barton</span>,</p>
<p>. . . I have brought down here with me Sydney Smith&rsquo;s 
Works, now first collected: you will delight in them: I shall 
bring them to Suffolk when I come: and it will not be long, I 
dare say, before I come, as there is to be rather a large meeting
of us at Boulge this August.&nbsp; I have got the fidgets in my 
right arm and hand (how the inconvenience redoubles as one 
mentions it)&mdash;do you know what the fidgets are?&mdash;a true
ailment, though perhaps not a dangerous one.&nbsp; Here I am 
again in the land of old Bunyan&mdash;better still in the land of
the more perennial Ouse, making many a fantastic winding and 
going much out of his direct way to fertilize and adorn.&nbsp; 
Fuller supposes that he lingers thus in the pleasant fields of 
Bedfordshire, being in no hurry to enter the more barren fens of 
Lincolnshire.&nbsp; So he says.&nbsp; This house is just on the 
edge of the town: a garden on one side skirted by the public road
which again is skirted by a row of such Poplars as only the Ouse 
knows how to rear&mdash;and pleasantly they rustle now&mdash;and 
the room in which I write is quite cool and opens into a 
greenhouse which opens into said garden: and it&rsquo;s all 
deuced pleasant.&nbsp; For in half an hour I shall seek my 
Piscator, <a name="citation61a"></a><a href="#footnote61a" 
class="citation">[61a]</a> and we shall go to a Village <a 
name="citation61b"></a><a href="#footnote61b"

in a pot-house, and so walk home.&nbsp; <!-- page 62--><a

idle ease I think I must be damned.&nbsp; I begin to have 
dreadful suspicions that this fruitless way of life is not looked
upon with satisfaction by the open eyes above.&nbsp; One really 
ought to dip for a little misery: perhaps however all this ease 
is only intended to turn sour by and bye, and so to poison one by
the very nature of self-indulgence.&nbsp; Perhaps again as 
idleness is so very great a trial of virtue, the idle man who 
keeps himself tolerably chaste, etc., may deserve the highest 
reward; the more idle, the more deserving.&nbsp; Really I 
don&rsquo;t jest: but I don&rsquo;t propound these things as 
certain.</p>
<p>There is a fair review of Shelley in the new Edinburgh: saying
the truth on many points where the truth was not easily 
enunciated, as I believe.</p>
<p>Now, dear sir, I have said all I have to say: and Carlyle 
says, you know, it is dangerous to attempt to say more.&nbsp; So 
farewell for the present: if you like to write soon, direct to 
the Post Office, Bedford: if not, I shall soon be at Woodbridge 
to anticipate the use of your pen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>I am very glad that you lifted yourself at last from your 
mahogany desk, and took such a trip as you describe in your last 
letter.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think you could have made a better in
the same given space of time.&nbsp; It is some years since I have
seen the Castle <!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>at Windsor, except from Eton.&nbsp; 
The view from the Terrace is the noblest I know of, taking it 
with all its associations together.&nbsp; Gray&rsquo;s Ode rises 
up into the mind as one looks around&mdash;does it not?&mdash;a 
sure proof that, however people may condemn certain conceits and 
expressions in the poem, the spirit of it is genuine.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Ye distant spires, ye antique towers&rsquo;&mdash;very 
large and noble, like the air that breathes upon one as one looks
down along the view.&nbsp; My brother John told me he thought the
Waterloo gallery very fine: the portraits by Sir Thomas almost as
fine as Vandyke.&nbsp; You saw them, of course.&nbsp; You say 
nothing of having seen the National Gallery in London: indeed I 
rather fear it is closed these two months.&nbsp; This is a great 
loss to you: the Rubens landscape you would never have 
forgot.&nbsp; Thank you for the picture of my dear old Bredfield 
which you have secured for me: it is most welcome.&nbsp; Poor 
Nursey once made me a very pretty oil sketch of it: but I gave it
to Mr. Jenney.&nbsp; By all means have it engraved for the pocket
book: it is well worthy.&nbsp; Some of the tall ash trees about 
it used to be visible at sea: but I think their topmost branches 
are decayed now.&nbsp; This circumstance I put in, because it 
will tell in your verse illustration of the view.&nbsp; From the 
road before the lawn, people used plainly to see the topmasts of 
the men-of war lying in Hollesley bay during the war.&nbsp; I 
like the idea of this: the old English house holding up its 
enquiring chimneys and weather cocks (there is great physiognomy 
in weathercocks) toward the far-off <!-- page 64--><a 
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>sea, and the 
ships upon it.&nbsp; How well I remember when we used all to be 
in the Nursery, and from the window see the hounds come across 
the lawn, my Father and Mr. Jenney in their hunting caps, etc., 
with their long whips&mdash;all Daguerreotyped into the 
mind&rsquo;s eye now&mdash;and that is all.&nbsp; Perhaps you are
not civilised enough to know what Daguerreotype is: no more do I 
well.&nbsp; We were all going on here as merrily as possible till
this day week, when my Piscator got an order from his Father to 
go home direct!)&nbsp; So go he would the day after.&nbsp; I 
wanted to go also: but they would have me stay here ten days 
more.&nbsp; So I stay: I suppose I shall be in London toward the 
end of this week however: and then it will not be long before I 
pay you a visit. . . .</p>
<p>I have gone through Homer&rsquo;s Iliad&mdash;sorry to have 
finished it.&nbsp; The accounts of the Zoolu people, with Dingarn
their king, etc., <a name="citation64"></a><a href="#footnote64" 
class="citation">[64]</a> give one a very good idea of the 
Homeric heroes, who were great brutes: but superior to the Gods 
who governed them: which also has been the case with most 
nations.&nbsp; It is a lucky thing that God made Man, and that 
Man has not to make God: we should fare badly, judging by the 
specimens already produced&mdash;Frankenstein Monster Gods, 
formed out of the worst and rottenest scraps of 
humanity&mdash;gigantic&mdash;and to turn destructively upon 
their Creators&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;But be ye of good cheer!&nbsp; I have

<p>So speaks a gentle voice.</p>
<p><!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
65</span>I found here a Number of Tait&rsquo;s Magazine for 
August last, containing a paper on Southey, Wordsworth, etc., by 
De Quincey.&nbsp; Incomplete and disproportioned like his other 
papers: but containing two noble passages: one, on certain years 
of his own Life when Opium shut him out from the world; the 
other, on Southey&rsquo;s style: in which he tells a truth which 
is obvious, directly it is told.&nbsp; Tait seems to be very well
worth a shilling a month: that is the price of him, I see.&nbsp; 
You have bought Carlyle&rsquo;s Miscellanies, have you not?&nbsp;
I long to get them: but one must wait till they are out of print 
before the Dublin booksellers shall have heard of them.&nbsp; Now
here is really a very long letter, and what is more, written with
a pen of my own mending&mdash;more consolatory to me than to 
you.&nbsp; Mr. Macnish&rsquo;s inscription <a 
name="citation65"></a><a href="#footnote65"

<blockquote><p>His lofty spirit was the home<br />

<p>. . . The country is now showing symptoms of greenness and 
warmth.&nbsp; Yesterday I walked (not a common thing for me) 
eleven miles; partly over a heath, covered with furze bushes just
come out into bloom, whose odour the fresh wind blew into my 
face.&nbsp; Such a day it was, only not so warm as when you and I
used to sit on those rocks overlooking the sea at Tenby, just 
eight years ago.&nbsp; I am afraid you are growing too good a

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Frederic</span>,</p>
<p>Your letter dated from the Eternal City on the 15th of May 
reached me here two days ago.&nbsp; Perhaps <!-- page 67--><a 
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>you have by 
this time left Naples to which you bid me direct: or will have 
left it by the time my letter gets there. . . .&nbsp; Our letters
are dated from two very different kinds of places: but perhaps 
equally well suited to the genius of the two men.&nbsp; For I am 
becoming more hebete every hour: and have not even the ambition 
to go up to London all this spring to see the Exhibitions, 
etc.&nbsp; I live in general quietly at my brother-in-law&rsquo;s
in Norfolk <a name="citation67"></a><a href="#footnote67" 
class="citation">[67]</a> and I look with tolerable composure on 
vegetating there for some time to come, and in due time handing 
out my eldest nieces to waltz, etc., at the County Balls.&nbsp; 
People affect to talk of this kind of life as very beautiful and 
philosophical: but I don&rsquo;t: men ought to have an ambition 
to stir, and travel, and fill their heads and senses: but so it 
is.&nbsp; Enough of what is now generally called the subjective 
style of writing.&nbsp; This word has made considerable progress 
in England during the year you have been away, so that people 
begin to fancy they understand what it means.&nbsp; I have been 
striving at it, because it is a very <i>sine qua non</i> 
condition in a book which I have just been reading, 
Eastlake&rsquo;s translation of Goethe&rsquo;s Theory of 
Colours.&nbsp; I recommend it to you, when you can get hold of 
it.&nbsp; Come back to England quick and read my copy.&nbsp; 
Goethe is all in opposition to Newton: and reduces the primitive 
colours to two.&nbsp; Whewell, I believe, does not patronise it: 
but it is certainly very Baconically put together.&nbsp; While 
you are wandering among <!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>ruins, waterfalls, and temples, and 
contemplating them as you sit in your lodgings, I poke about with
a book and a colour-box by the side of the river Ouse&mdash;quiet
scenery enough&mdash;and make horrible sketches.&nbsp; The best 
thing to me in Italy would be that you are there.&nbsp; But I 
hope you will soon come home and install yourself again in 
Mornington Crescent.&nbsp; I have just come from Leamington: 
while there, I met Alfred by chance: we made two or three 
pleasant excursions together: to Stratford upon Avon and 
Kenilworth, etc.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t these names sound very thin 
amid your warm southern nomenclature?&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll be 
bound you would be pleased to exchange all your fine burnt up 
places for a look at a Warwickshire pasture every now and then 
during these hot days. . . .</p>
<p>The sun shines very bright, and there is a kind of bustle in 
these clean streets, because there is to be a grand True Blue 
dinner in the town Hall.&nbsp; Not that I am going: in an hour or
two I shall be out in the fields rambling alone.&nbsp; I read 
Burnet&rsquo;s History&mdash;ex pede Herculem.&nbsp; Well, say as
you will, there is not, and never was, such a country as Old 
England&mdash;never were there such a Gentry as the 
English.&nbsp; They will be the distinguishing mark and glory of 
England in History, as the Arts were of Greece, and War of 
Rome.&nbsp; I am sure no travel would carry me to any land so 
beautiful, as the good sense, justice, and liberality of my good 
countrymen make this.&nbsp; And I cling the closer to it, because
I feel that we are going down the hill, and shall perhaps live 
ourselves <!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>to talk of all this independence as a
thing that has been.&nbsp; To none of which you assent 
perhaps.&nbsp; At all events, my paper is done, and it is time to
have done with this solemn letter.&nbsp; I can see you sitting at
a window that looks out on the bay of Naples, and Vesuvius with a
faint smoke in the distance: a half-naked man under you cutting 
up watermelons, etc.&nbsp; Haven&rsquo;t I seen it all in 
Annuals, and in the Ballet of Massaniello long ago?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear John Allen</span>,</p>
<p>I wrote a good bit of a letter to you three weeks ago: but, 
being non-plussed suddenly, tore it up.&nbsp; Lusia says she has 
had a letter from Mrs. Allen, telling how you had a troublesome 
and even dangerous passage to Tenby: but that there you arrived 
at last.&nbsp; And there I suppose you are.&nbsp; The <i>veteris 
vestigia flamm&aelig;</i>, or old pleasant recollections of our 
being together at that place make me begin another sheet to 
you.&nbsp; I am almost convicted in my own mind of ingratitude 
for not having travelled long ago to Pembrokeshire, to show my 
most kind friends of Freestone that I remember their kindness, 
and that they made my stay so pleasant as to make me wish to test
their hospitality again.&nbsp; Nothing but <!-- page 70--><a 
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>my besetting 
indolence (the strongest thing about me) could have prevented my 
doing this.&nbsp; I should like much to see Mr. and Mrs. Allen 
again, and Carew Castle, and walk along the old road traversed by
you and me several times between Freestone and Tenby.&nbsp; Does 
old Penelly Top stand where it did, faintly discernible in these 
rainy skies?&nbsp; Do you sit ever upon that rock that juts out 
by Tenby harbour, where you and I sat one day seven years ago, 
and quoted G. Herbert?&nbsp; Lusia tells me also that nice Mary 
Allen is to be married to your brother&mdash;Charles, I 
think.&nbsp; She is really one of the pleasantest remembrances of
womanhood I have.&nbsp; I suppose she sits still in an upper 
room, with an old turnip of a watch (tell her I remember this) on
the table beside her as she reads wholesome books.&nbsp; As I 
write, I remember different parts of the house and the garden, 
and the fields about.&nbsp; Is it absolutely <i>that</i> Mary 
Allen that is to become Mrs. Charles Allen?&nbsp; Pray write, and
let me hear of this from yourself.&nbsp; Another thing also: are 
you to become our Rector in Sussex?&nbsp; This is another of 
Lusia&rsquo;s scandals.&nbsp; I rather hope it is true: but not 
quite.&nbsp; Lusia is pretty well: better, I think, than when she
first came down from London. . . .&nbsp; She makes herself 
tolerably happy down here: and wishes to exert herself: which is 
the highest wish a FitzGerald can form.&nbsp; I go on as usual, 
and in a way that needs no explanation to you: reading a little, 
drawing a <!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>little, playing a little, smoking a 
little, etc.&nbsp; I have got hold of Herodotus now: the most 
interesting of all Historians.&nbsp; But I find the disadvantage 
of being so ill-grounded and bad a scholar: I can get at the 
broad sense: but all the delicacies (in which so much of the 
beauty and character of an author lie) escape me sadly.&nbsp; The
more I read, the more I feel this.&nbsp; But what does it all 
signify?&nbsp; Time goes on, and we get older; and whether my 
idleness comprehends the distinctions of the 1st and 2nd Aorist 
will not be noted much in the Book of Life, either on this or the
other side of the leaf.&nbsp; Here is a letter written on this 
Sunday Night, July 12, 1840.&nbsp; And it shall go 
to-morrow.&nbsp; My kind remembrances to Mrs. Allen: and (I beg 
you to transmit them) to all my fore-known friends at 
Freestone.&nbsp; And believe me yours now as I have been and hope
to be ever affectionately,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Fellow</span>,</p>
<p>Many thanks for your kind long letter.&nbsp; It brought me 
back to the green before the house at Freestone, and the old 
schoolroom in it.&nbsp; I have always felt within myself that if 
ever I did go again to Freestone, I should puzzle myself and 
every one <!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>else by bringing back old 
associations among existing things: I should have felt 
awkward.&nbsp; The place remains quite whole in my mind: Anne 
Allen&rsquo;s damask cheek forming part of the colouring 
therein.&nbsp; I remember a little well somewhere in the woods 
about a mile from the house: and those faint reports of 
explosions from towards Milford, etc., which we used to hear when
we all walked out together.&nbsp; You are to thank Mary Allen for
her kind wishes: and tell her she need not doubt that I wish her 
all good things.&nbsp; I enclose you as you see a little drawing 
of a Suffolk farm house close here: copied from a sketch of poor 
Mr. Nursey.&nbsp; If you think it worth giving to Mary Allen, do:
it seems, and perhaps is, very namby-pamby to send this: but she 
and I used to talk of drawings together: and this will let her 
know that I go on just the same as I did eight years ago.&nbsp; 
N.B.&nbsp; It is not intended as a nuptial present.</p>
<p>Now, you need not answer this letter: as you have done 
remarkably well already.&nbsp; I am living (did I tell you this 
before?) at a little cottage close by the lawn gates, where I 
have my books, a barrel of beer which I tap myself (can you tap a
barrel of beer?), and an old woman to do for me.&nbsp; I have 
also just concocted two gallons of Tar water under the directions
of Bishop Berkeley: it is to be bottled off this very day after a
careful skimming: and then drunk by those who can and will.&nbsp;
It is to be tried first on my old woman: if she survives, <!--

the Parish, through England, Europe, etc., &lsquo;as the small

much scandalized at Thirlwall&rsquo;s being made a Bishop: 
Isabella <a name="citation73a"></a><a href="#footnote73a"

that Thirlwall had so bad a character at Trinity that many would 
not associate with him.&nbsp; I do not think however that I would
have made him Bishop: I am all for good and not great 
Bishops.&nbsp; Old Evans <a name="citation73b"></a><a 
href="#footnote73b" class="citation">[73b]</a> would have done 
better.&nbsp; I am become an Oxford High Church Divine after 
Newman: whose sermons are the best that ever were written in my 
judgment.&nbsp; Cecil I have read: and liked for his good 
sense.&nbsp; Is the croft at Tenby still green: and does Mary 
Allen take a turn on it in a riding habit as of old?&nbsp; And I 
remember a ravine on the horn of the bay opposite the town where 
the sea rushes up.&nbsp; I mean as you go on past the 
croft.&nbsp; I can walk there as in a dream.&nbsp; I see 
Thackeray&rsquo;s book <a name="citation73c"></a><a

to be published, and I hear Spedding has written a Review of 
Carlyle&rsquo;s Revolution in the Edinburgh.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t

that, except it be supported by his other works.&nbsp; Parts may

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>I duly received your letter.&nbsp; I am just returned from 
staying three days at a delightful Inn by the river Ouse, where 
we always go to fish.&nbsp; I dare say I have told you about it 
before.&nbsp; The Inn is the cleanest, the sweetest, the 
civillest, the quietest, the liveliest, and the cheapest that 
ever was built or conducted.&nbsp; Its name, the Falcon of 
Bletsoe.&nbsp; On one side it has a garden, then the meadows 
through which winds the Ouse: on the other, the public road, with
its coaches hurrying on to London, its market people halting to 
drink, its farmers, horsemen, and foot travellers.&nbsp; So, as 
one&rsquo;s humour is, one can have whichever phase of life one 
pleases: quietude or bustle; solitude or the busy hum of men: one
can sit in the principal room with a tankard and a pipe and see 
both these phases at once through the windows that open upon 
either.&nbsp; But through all these delightful places they talk 
of leading railroads: a sad thing, I am sure: quite 
impolitic.&nbsp; But Mammon is blind.</p>
<p>I went a week ago to see Luton, Lord Bute&rsquo;s <!-- page 
75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
75</span>place; filled with very fine pictures, of which I have 
dreamt since.&nbsp; It is the gallery in England that I most wish
to see again: but I by no means say it is the most 
valuable.&nbsp; A great many pictures seemed to me 
misnamed&mdash;especially Correggio has to answer for some he 
never painted.</p>
<p>I am thinking of going to Naseby for a little while: after 
which I shall return here: and very likely find my way back to 
Norfolk before long.&nbsp; At all events, the middle of October 
will find me at Boulge, unless the Fates are very contrary.</p>

hit off an outline in this clear atmosphere.&rsquo;&nbsp; For 
this fresh sunlight is not a mere dead medium of light, but is so

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Frederic</span>,</p>
<p>I have just concluded, with all the throes of imprudent 
pleasure, the purchase of a large picture by Constable, of which,
if I can continue in the mood, I will enclose you a sketch.&nbsp;
It is very good: but <!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>how you and Morton would abuse 
it!&nbsp; Yet this, being a sketch, escapes some of 
Constable&rsquo;s faults, and might escape some of your 
censures.&nbsp; The trees are not splashed with that white 
sky-mud, which (according to Constable&rsquo;s theory) the Earth 
scatters up with her wheels in travelling so briskly round the 
sun; and there is a dash and felicity in the execution that gives
one a thrill of good digestion in one&rsquo;s room, and the 
thought of which makes one inclined to jump over the 
children&rsquo;s heads in the streets.&nbsp; But if you could see
my great enormous Venetian Picture you would be extonished.&nbsp;
Does the thought ever strike you, when looking at pictures in a 
house, that you are to run and jump at one, and go right through 
it into some behind-scene world on the other side, as Harlequins 
do?&nbsp; A steady portrait especially invites one to do so: the 
quietude of it ironically tempts one to outrage it: one feels it 
would close again over the panel, like water, as if nothing had 
happened.&nbsp; That portrait of Spedding, for instance, which 
Laurence has given me: not swords, nor cannon, nor all the Bulls 
of Bashan butting at it, could, I feel sure, discompose that 
venerable forehead.&nbsp; No wonder that no hair can grow at such
an altitude: no wonder his view of Bacon&rsquo;s virtue is so 
rarefied that the common consciences of men cannot endure 
it.&nbsp; Thackeray and I occasionally amuse ourselves with the 
idea of Spedding&rsquo;s forehead: we find it somehow or other in
all things, <!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>just peering out of all things: you 
see it in a milestone, Thackeray says.&nbsp; He also draws the 
forehead rising with a sober light over Mont Blanc, and reflected
in the lake of Geneva.&nbsp; We have great laughing over 
this.&nbsp; The forehead is at present in Pembrokeshire, I 
believe: or Glamorganshire: or Monmouthshire: it is hard to say 
which.&nbsp; It has gone to spend its Christmas there.</p>
<p>[A water-colour sketch of Constable&rsquo;s picture.]</p>
<p>This you see is a sketch of my illustrious new purchase.&nbsp;
The two animals in the water are cows: that on the bank a dog: 
and that in the glade of the wood a man or woman as you may 
choose.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t say my drawing gives you much idea of
my picture, except as to the composition of it: and even that 
depends on the colour and disposition of light and shade.&nbsp; 
The effect of the light breaking under the trees is very 
beautiful in the original: but this can only be given in 
water-colours on thick paper, where one can scratch out the 
lights.&nbsp; One would fancy that Constable had been looking at 
that fine picture of Gainsborough&rsquo;s in the National: the 
Watering Place: which is superior, in my mind, to all the Claudes
there.&nbsp; But this is perhaps because I am an Englishman and 
not an Italian.</p>

[21 March, 1841.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Frederic Tennyson</span>,</p>
<p>I was very glad indeed to get a letter from you this 
morning.&nbsp; You here may judge, by the very nature of things, 
that I lose no time in answering it.&nbsp; I did not receive your
Sicilian letter: and have been for a year and half quite ignorant
of what part of the world you were in.&nbsp; I supposed you were 
alive: though I don&rsquo;t quite know why.&nbsp; De non 
existentibus et non apparentibus eadem est ratio.&nbsp; I heard 
from Morton three months ago: he was then at Venice: very tired 
of it: but lying on such luxurious sofas that he could not make 
up his mind to move from them.&nbsp; He wanted to meet you: or at
all events to hear of you.&nbsp; I wrote to him, but could tell 
him nothing.&nbsp; I have also seen Alfred once or twice since 
you have <!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>gone: he is to be found in certain 
conjunctions of the stars at No. 8 Charlotte Street. . . .&nbsp; 
All our other friends are in statu quo: Spedding residing calmly 
in Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields: at the Colonial all day: at the 
play and smoking at night: occasionally to be found in the 
Edinburgh Review.&nbsp; Pollock and the Lawyer tribe travel to 
and fro between their chambers in the Temple and Westminster 
Hall: occasionally varying their travels, when the Chancellor 
chooses, to the Courts in Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn.&nbsp; As to me, I 
am fixed here where your letter found me: very rarely going to 
London: and staying there but a short time when I do go.&nbsp; 
You, Morton, Spedding, Thackeray, and Alfred, were my chief 
solace there: and only Spedding is now to be found.&nbsp; 
Thackeray lives in Paris.</p>
<p>From this you may judge that I have no such sights to tell of 
as you have.&nbsp; Neither do <i>mortaletti</i> ever go off at 
Boulge: which is perhaps not to be regretted.&nbsp; Day follows 
day with unvaried movement: there is the same level meadow with 
geese upon it always lying before my eyes: the same pollard oaks:
with now and then the butcher or the washerwoman trundling by in 
their carts.&nbsp; As you have lived in Lincolnshire I will not 
further describe Suffolk.&nbsp; No new books (except a perfectly 
insane one of Carlyle, <a name="citation82"></a><a 
href="#footnote82" class="citation">[82]</a> who is becoming very
obnoxious now that he is become popular), nor new pictures, no 
music.&nbsp; A game at picquet of two hours duration closes each 
day.&nbsp; But <!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>for that I might say with 
Titus&mdash;perdidi diem.&nbsp; Oh Lord! all this is not told you
that you may admire my philosophic quietude, etc.; pray 
don&rsquo;t think that.&nbsp; I should travel like you if I had 
the eyes to see that you have: but, as Goethe says, the eye can 
but see what it brings with it the power of seeing.&nbsp; If 
anything I had seen in my short travels had given me any new 
ideas worth having I should travel more: as it is, I see your 
Italian lakes and cities in the Picturesque Annuals as well as I 
should in the reality.&nbsp; You have a more energetic, stirring,
acquisitive, and capacious soul.&nbsp; I mean all this seriously,
believe me: but I won&rsquo;t say any more about it.&nbsp; Morton
also is a capital traveller: I wish he would keep notes of what 
he sees, and publish them one day.</p>
<p>I must however tell you that I am becoming a Farmer!&nbsp; Can
you believe in this?&nbsp; I hope we shall both live to laugh 
over it together.&nbsp; When do you mean to come back?&nbsp; Pray
do not let so long a time elapse again without writing to me: 
never mind a long letter: write something to say you are alive 
and where.&nbsp; Rome certainly is nearer England than Naples: so
perhaps you are coming back.&nbsp; Bring Morton back with 
you.&nbsp; I will then go to London and we will smoke together 
and be as merry as sandboys.&nbsp; We will all sit under the calm
shadow of Spedding&rsquo;s forehead.&nbsp; People talk of a war 
with America.&nbsp; Poor dear old England! she makes a gallant 
shew in her old age.&nbsp; If Englishmen are to <!-- page 84--><a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>travel, I am 
glad that such as you are abroad&mdash;good specimens of 
Englishmen: with the proper fiert&eacute; about them.&nbsp; The 
greater part are poor wretches that go to see oranges growing, 
and hear Bellini for eighteen-pence.&nbsp; I hope the English are
as proud and disagreeable as ever.&nbsp; What an odd thing that 
the Italians like such martial demonstrations as you 
describe&mdash;not at all odd, probably&mdash;their spirit begins
and goes off in noise and smoke.&nbsp; It is like all other grand
aspirations.&nbsp; So ---&rsquo;s Epics crepitate in 
Sonnets.&nbsp; All I ask of you is to write no Sonnets on what 
you see or hear&mdash;no sonnets can sound well after Daddy 
Wordsworth, ---, etc., who have now succeeded in quite spoiling 
one&rsquo;s pleasure in Milton&rsquo;s&mdash;and they are heavy 
things.&nbsp; The words &lsquo;subjective and objective&rsquo; 
are getting into general use now, and Donne has begun with 
<i>&aelig;sthetics</i> and <i>exegetical</i> in Kemble&rsquo;s 
review.&nbsp; Kemble himself has written an article on the 
Emperor Nicholas which must crush him.&nbsp; If you could read 
it, no salvos of <i>mortalletti</i> could ever startle you 
again.&nbsp; And now my paper is almost covered: and I must say 
Good bye to you.&nbsp; This is Sunday March 21&mdash;a fine sunny
blowing day.&nbsp; We shall dine at one o&rsquo;clock&mdash;an 
hour hence&mdash;go to Church&mdash;then walk&mdash;have tea at 
six, and pass rather a dull evening, because of no picquet.&nbsp;
You will be sauntering in St. Peter&rsquo;s perhaps, or standing 
on the Capitol while the sun sets.&nbsp; I should like to see 
Rome after all.&nbsp; Livy&rsquo;s lies (as the &aelig;sthetics 
prove them to be) do at least animate one so far&mdash;<!-- page 
85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>how 
far?&mdash;so far as to wish, and not to do, having perfect power
to do.</p>

<p>. . . I had a long letter from Morton the other day&mdash;he 
is still luxuriating at Venice.&nbsp; Also a letter from Frederic
Tennyson, who has been in Sicily, etc., and is much distracted 
between enjoyment of those climates and annoyance from 
Fleas.&nbsp; These two men are to be at Rome together soon: so if
any one wants to go to Rome, now is a good time.&nbsp; I wish I 
was there.&nbsp; F. Tennyson says that he and a party of 
Englishmen fought a cricket match with the crew of the 
Bellerophon on the <i>Parthenop&aelig;an hills</i> (query about 
the correctness of this&mdash;I quote from memory), and 
<i>sacked</i> the sailors by 90 runs.&nbsp; Is not this 
pleasant?&mdash;the notion of good English blood striving in worn
out Italy&mdash;I like that such men as Frederic should be 
abroad: so strong, haughty and passionate.&nbsp; They keep up the
English character abroad. . . .&nbsp; Have you read poor 
Carlyle&rsquo;s raving book about heroes?&nbsp; Of course you 
have, or I would ask you to buy my copy.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like
to live with it in the house.&nbsp; It smoulders.&nbsp; He ought

retire to the Tale of a Tub, Tristram Shandy, and Horace Walpole,

<i>July</i> 26, 1841.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Frederic</span>,</p>
<p>I got your letter ten days ago in London on my way here.&nbsp;
We have incessant rain, which is as bad as your sciroccos; at 
least it damps my energies very much.&nbsp; But people are 
accustomed to it in Ireland: and my uncle (in whose house I am 
staying) is just set off with three of his children&mdash;on 
horseback&mdash;cantering and laughing away in the midst of a 
hopeless shower.&nbsp; I am afraid some of us are too indolent 
for such things.</p>
<p>I am glad Morton has taken up painting in good earnest, and I 
shall encourage him to persevere as much as I can. . . .&nbsp; I 
have begun to draw a little&mdash;the fit comes upon one in 
summer with the foliage: as to sunshine, so necessary for 
pictures, I have been obliged to do without that.&nbsp; We have 
had scarce a ray for a month . . .&nbsp; I have read nothing, 
except the Annual Register: which is not amiss in a certain state
of mind, and is not easily exhausted.&nbsp; A goodly row of some 
hundred very thick volumes which may <!-- page 87--><a 
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>be found in 
every country town wherever one goes forbid all danger of 
exhaustion.&nbsp; So long as there is appetite, there is food: 
and of that plain substantial nature which, Johnson says, suits 
the stomach of middle life.&nbsp; Burke, for instance, is a 
sufficiently poetical politician to interest one just when 
one&rsquo;s sonneteering age is departing, but before one has 
come down quite to arid fact.&nbsp; Do you know anything of poor 
Sir Egerton Brydges?&mdash;this, in talking of sonnets&mdash;poor
fellow, he wrote them for seventy years, fully convinced of their
goodness, and only lamenting that the public were unjust and 
stupid enough not to admire them also.&nbsp; He lived in haughty 
seclusion, and at the end of life wrote a doating 
Autobiography.&nbsp; He writes good prose however, and shews 
himself as he is very candidly: indeed he is proud of the 
display.</p>
<p>All this is not meant to be a lesson to you who write, 
everybody says, good sonnets.&nbsp; Sir E. Brydges would have 
been the same dilettante if he had written Epics&mdash;probably 
worse.&nbsp; I certainly don&rsquo;t like sonnets, as you know: 
we have been spoiled for them by Daddy Wordsworth, ---, and 
Co.&nbsp; Moxon must write them too forsooth.&nbsp; What do they 
seem fit for but to serve as little shapes in which a man may 
mould very mechanically any single thought which comes into his 
head, which thought is not lyrical enough in itself to exhale in 
a more lyrical measure?&nbsp; The difficulty of the sonnet metre 
in English is a good excuse for the dull didactic thoughts which 
<!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
88</span>naturally incline towards it: fellows know there is no 
danger of decanting their muddy stuff ever so slowly: they are 
neither prose nor poetry.&nbsp; I have rather a wish to tie old 
Wordsworth&rsquo;s volume about his neck and pitch him into one 
of the deepest holes of his dear Duddon.</p>
<p>But it is very stupid to write all this to Italy, though it 
would have done very well to have canvassed with you and Morton 
over our pipes in Mornington Crescent.&nbsp; I suppose you never 
will come back to stay long in England again: I have given you up
to a warmer latitude.&nbsp; If you were more within reach, I 
would make you go a trip with me to the West of Ireland, whither 
I am not confident enough to go alone.&nbsp; Yet I wish to see 
it.</p>

<p>You must allow I am a good correspondent&mdash;this half year 
at least.&nbsp; This is Septr. 2, a most horrible day for a 
Bazaar, judging at least by the weather here.&nbsp; But you may 
be better off.&nbsp; I came to this house a week ago to visit a 
male friend, who duly started to England the day before I got 
here.&nbsp; I therefore found myself domiciled in a house filled 
with ladies of divers ages&mdash;Edgeworth&rsquo;s wife,

great Maria) aged <!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span

I am quite at home.&nbsp; But surely I must go to England soon: 
it seems to me as if that must take place soon: and so send me a

chattering away.&nbsp; We are great friends.&nbsp; She is as 
lively, active, and cheerful as if she were but twenty; really a 
very entertaining person.&nbsp; We talk about Walter Scott whom 
she adores, and are merry all the day long.&nbsp; I have read 
about thirty-two sets of novels since I have been here: it has 
rained nearly all the time.</p>
<p>I long to hear how the Bazaar went off: and so I beg you to 
tell me all about it.&nbsp; When I began this letter I thought I 
had something to say: but I believe the truth was I had nothing 
to do.&nbsp; When you see my dear Major <a 
name="citation89"></a><a href="#footnote89" 
class="citation">[89]</a> give him my love, and tell him I wish 
he were here to go to Connemara with me: I have no heart to go 
alone.&nbsp; The discomfort of Irish inns requires a companion in
misery.&nbsp; This part of the country is poorer than any I have 
yet seen: the <!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span

face and dress.&nbsp; Have you read The Collegians? <a

<p>I have now begun to sketch heads on the blotting paper on 
which my paper rests&mdash;a sure sign, as Miss Edgeworth tells 
me, that I have said quite enough.&nbsp; She is right.&nbsp; 
Good-bye.&nbsp; In so far as this country is Ireland I am glad to
be here: but inasmuch as it is not England I wish I were 
there.</p>

<p>. . . Do you know that I wanted you to come down by the 
railroad and see me here: where there is nothing else to be seen 
but myself: which would have been a comfort to you.&nbsp; I have 
been staying here three weeks alone, smoking with farmers, 
looking at their lands, and taking long walks alone: during which
(as well as when I was in Ireland) I made such sketches as will 
make you throw down your brush in despair.&nbsp; I wish you would
ask at Molteno&rsquo;s or Colnaghi&rsquo;s for a new Lithographic
print of a head of Dante, after a fresco by Giotto, lately 
discovered in some chapel <a name="citation90b"></a><a 
href="#footnote90b" class="citation">[90b]</a> at Florence.&nbsp;
It is the most wonderful head that ever was seen&mdash;Dante at 
about twenty-seven years old: rather younger.&nbsp; The 
Edgeworths had a <!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span

interest in Florence before the legitimate publication: but they 
told me it was to be abroad in September.&nbsp; If you can get me

<p>I am surprised you think my scanty letters are worth 
encouraging, especially with such long and excellent answers as 
that I have just got from you.&nbsp; It has found its way down 
here: and oddly enough does your Italian scenery, painted, I 
believe, very faithfully upon my inner eye, contrast with the 
British barrenness of the Field of Naseby.&nbsp; Yet here was 
fought a battle of some interest to Englishmen: and I am 
persuading farmers to weed well the corn that grows over those 
who died there.&nbsp; No, no; in spite of your Vesuviuses and 
sunshine, I love my poor dear brave barren ugly country.&nbsp; 
Talk of your Italians! why, they are extinguished by the 
Austrians because they don&rsquo;t blaze enough of themselves to 
burn the extinguisher.&nbsp; Only people who deserve despotism 
are forced to suffer it.&nbsp; We have at last good weather: and 
the harvest is just drawing to a close in this place.&nbsp; It is
a bright brisk morning, and the loaded waggons are rolling 
cheerfully past my window.&nbsp; But since I wrote what is above 
a whole day has passed: I have <!-- page 92--><a 
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>eaten a bread
dinner: taken a lonely walk: made a sketch of Naseby (not the 
least like yours of Castellamare): played for an hour on an old 
tub of a piano: and went out in my dressing-gown to smoke a pipe 
with a tenant hard by.&nbsp; That tenant (whose name is Love, by 
the bye) was out with his folks in the stack yard: getting in all
the corn they can, as the night looks rainy.&nbsp; So, 
disappointed of my projected &lsquo;talk about runts&rsquo; and 
turnips, I am come back&mdash;with a good deal of animal spirits 
at my tongue&rsquo;s and fingers&rsquo; ends.&nbsp; If I were 
transported now into your room at Castellamare, I would wag my 
tongue far beyond midnight with you.&nbsp; These fits of 
exultation are not very common with me: as (after leaving off 
beef) my life has become of an even grey paper character: needing
no great excitement, and as pleased with Naseby as Naples. . . 
.</p>
<p>I am reading Schlegel&rsquo;s lectures on the History of 
Literature: a nice just book: as also the comedies of Congreve, 
Vanbrugh, and Farquhar: the latter very delightful: as also 
D&rsquo;Aubign&eacute;&rsquo;s History of the Reformation, a good
book.&nbsp; When I am tired of one I take up the other: when 
tired of all, I take up my pipe, or sit down and recollect some 
of Fidelio on the pianoforte.&nbsp; Ah Master Tennyson, we in 
England have our pleasures too.&nbsp; As to Alfred, I have heard 
nothing of him since May: except that some one saw him going to a
packet which he believed was going to Rotterdam. . . .&nbsp; When
shall you and I go to an Opera again, or hear one of 
Beethoven&rsquo;s Symphonies together?&nbsp; You <!-- page 
93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>are 
lost to England, I calculate: and I am given over to turnips and 
inanity.&nbsp; So runs the world away.&nbsp; Well, if I never see
you again, I am very very glad I <i>have</i> seen you: and got 
the idea of a noble fellow all ways into my head.&nbsp; Does this
seem like humbug to you?&nbsp; But it is not.&nbsp; And that fine
fellow Morton too.&nbsp; Pray write when you can to me: and when 
my stars shine so happily about my head as they do at this 
minute, when my blood feels like champagne, I will answer you. .

<p>When you go to Florence, get to see a fresco portrait of Dante
by Giotto: newly discovered in some chapel there.&nbsp; Edgeworth
saw it, and has brought home a print which is (he says) a 
tolerable copy.&nbsp; It is a most awful head: Dante, when about 
twenty-five years old.&nbsp; The likeness to the common portraits
of him when old is quite evident.&nbsp; All his great poem seems 
in it: like the flower in the bud.&nbsp; I read the last cantos 
of the Paradiso over and over again.&nbsp; I forget if you like 
him: but, if I understand you at all, you must.&nbsp;

<p style="text-align: center"><i>To Bernard Barton</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>, 
<i>November</i> 27/41.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Barton</span>,</p>
<p>I am afraid you were disappointed last night at finding no 
picture by the Shannon. <a name="citation93"></a><a 
href="#footnote93" class="citation">[93]</a>&nbsp; Mayhap you 
<!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
94</span>had asked Mr C[hurchyard] to come and give his judgment 
upon it over toasted cheese.&nbsp; But the truth is, the picture 
has just been varnished with mastick varnish, which is apt to 
chill with the cold at this season of the year: and so I thought 
it best to keep it by me till its conveyance should be 
safer.&nbsp; I hope that on Monday you will get it.&nbsp; But I 
must tell you that, besides the reason of the varnish, I have had
a sneaking desire to keep the picture by me, and not to lose it 
from my eyes just yet.&nbsp; I am in love with it.&nbsp; I washed
it myself very carefully with only sweet salad oil: perfectly 
innocuous as you may imagine: and that, with the new lining, and 
the varnishing, has at least made the difference between a dirty 
and a clean beauty.&nbsp; And now, whoever it may be painted by, 
I pronounce it a very beautiful picture: tender, graceful, full 
of repose.&nbsp; I sit looking at it in my room and like it more 
and more.&nbsp; All this is independent of its paternity.&nbsp; 
But if I am asked about that, I should only answer on my own 
judgment (not a good one in such a matter, as I have told you) 
that it is decidedly by Gainsborough, and in his best way of 
conception.&nbsp; My argument would be of the Johnsonian kind: if
it is not by G., who the devil is it by?&nbsp; There are some 
perhaps feeble touches here and there in the tree in the centre, 
though not in those autumnal leaves that shoot into the sky to 
the right: but who painted that clump of thick solemn trees to 
the left of the picture:&mdash;the light of evening rising like a
low fire between their boles?&nbsp; The cattle too <!-- page 
95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>in 
the water, how they stand!&nbsp; The picture must be an original 
of somebody&rsquo;s: and if not of 
Gainsborough&rsquo;s&mdash;whose?&nbsp; It is better painted far 
than the Market Cart in the National Gallery: but not better, 
only equal (in a sketchy way) to the beautiful evening Watering 
Place.</p>
<p>Now I have raised your expectations too high.&nbsp; But when 
you have looked at the picture some time, you will agree with 
me.&nbsp; I say all this in sober honesty, for upon my word, 
whether it be by Gainsborough or not, it is a kind of pang to me 
to part from the picture: I believe I should like it all the 
better for its being a little fatherless bastard which I have 
picked up in the streets, and made clean and comfortable.&nbsp; 
Yet, if your friend tells you it is by G. I shall be glad you 
should possess it.&nbsp; Any how, never part with it but to 
me.</p>
<p>I must tell you my friend Laurence still persists it is not by
Gainsborough: but I have thrown him quite overboard.&nbsp; Oh the
comfort of independent self confidence!&nbsp; Said Laurence also 
observed that Gainsborough was the Goldsmith of Painters: which 
is perhaps true.&nbsp; I should like to know if he would know an 
original of Goldsmith, if I read something to him.&nbsp; He is a 
nice fellow this Laurence by the way.</p>
<p>Our prospect of going down to Suffolk this year is much on the
wane: the Doctor has desired that Lusia should remain in 
town.&nbsp; Though I should like much to see you and others, yet 
I am on the whole <!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>glad that my sisters should stay 
here, where they are likely to be better off.&nbsp; I shall stay 
with them, as I am of use.&nbsp; I may however run down one day 
to give you a look.&nbsp; I wish you would enquire and let me 
know how Mr. Jenney <a name="citation96"></a><a 
href="#footnote96" class="citation">[96]</a> is: he was not well 
when my Father was in Suffolk.&nbsp; Only <i>don&rsquo;t ask 
himself</i>: he hates that.&nbsp; And now farewell.&nbsp; This is
a long letter: but look at it by way of notice when the picture 
comes to you.&nbsp; If it does not come on Monday don&rsquo;t be 
angry: but it probably will.</p>

<p>The account you give of my old Squire &lsquo;that he is in a 
poorish way&rsquo; does not satisfy me: and I want you to ask Mr.
Jones the surgeon, whom you know, and who used to attend on the 
Squire,&mdash;to ask him, I say, how that Squire is.&nbsp; He has
been ill for the last two or three winters, and may not be worse 
now than before.&nbsp; He is one of our oldest friends: and 
though he and I have not very much in common, he is a part of my 
country of England, and involved in the very idea of the quiet 
fields of Suffolk.&nbsp; He is the owner of old Bredfield House 
in which I was born&mdash;and the seeing him cross the stiles 
between Hasketon and Bredfield, and riding with his hounds over 
the lawn, is among the scenes in that novel called The Past which
dwell most in my memory.&nbsp; What is the difference between 
what has been, and <!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>what never has been, 
<i>none</i>?&nbsp; At the same time this Squire, so hardy, is 
indignant at the idea of being ill or laid up: so one must 
inquire of him by some roundabout means. . . .</p>
<p>We had a large party here last night: Horace Smith came: like 
his brother James, but better looking: and said to be very 
agreeable.&nbsp; Do you [know] that he gives a dreadful account 
of Mrs. Southey: that meek and Christian poetess: he says, 
she&rsquo;s a devil in temper.&nbsp; He told my mother so: had 
you heard of this?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe it yet: one ought 
not so soon, ought one?</p>

you have not been asked to Lecture at the Ipswich

<p>You tell my Father you mean to write a Poem about my 
invisibility&mdash;and somehow it seems strange to myself that I 
have been so long absent from Woodbridge.&nbsp; It was a toss up 
(as boys say&mdash;and perhaps Gods) whether I should go 
now:&mdash;the toss has decided I should not.&nbsp; On the 
contrary I am going to see Donne at Mattishall: a visit, which 
having put off a fortnight ago, I am now determined to pay.&nbsp;
But if I do not see you before I go to London, I shall assuredly 
be down again by the latter part of February: when toasted cheese
and ale shall again unite our souls.&nbsp; You need not however 
expect that I can return to such familiar intercourse as once (in
former days) passed between us.&nbsp; New honours in society have
devolved upon me the <!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>necessity of a more dignified 
deportment.&nbsp; A letter has been sent from the Secretary of 
the Ipswich Mechanics&rsquo; Institution asking me to 
Lecture&mdash;any subject but Party Politics or Controversial 
Divinity.&nbsp; On my politely declining, another, a fuller, and 
a more pressing, letter was sent urging me to comply with their 
demand: I answered to the same effect, but with accelerated 
dignity.&nbsp; I am now awaiting the third request in confidence:
if you see no symptoms of its being mooted, perhaps you will 
kindly propose it.&nbsp; I have prepared an answer.&nbsp; Donne 
is mad with envy.&nbsp; He consoles himself with having got a 
Roman History to write for Lardner&rsquo;s Cabinet 
Cyclop&aelig;dia. <a name="citation99"></a><a href="#footnote99"

Histories are readable.&nbsp; I am afraid Donne will stick to 
what is considered the Truth too much.</p>

<p>You mistake.&nbsp; The Poacher was bought in his

As you desire a packing case, I will order one to day: and I hope
you will have him down on Wednesday, just when your Bank work is 
over, and you will be glad <!-- page 100--><a 
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>of such 
good company.&nbsp; One of my friends thought the picture must 
have been an anticipation of Bill Sykes: put a cap and feathers 
on his head and you make him Iago, Richard the Third, or any 
other aristocratic villain.&nbsp; I really think the picture is a
very good one of its kind: and one that you will like. <a

<p>I am going to get my large Constable very lightly framed, and

<p>. . . There is something poetical, and almost heroic, in this 
Expedition to the Niger&mdash;the motives lofty and

A. Cunningham&rsquo;s Scottish Songs <a 
name="citation100b"></a><a href="#footnote100b"

To the primrose <a name="citation100c"></a><a 
href="#footnote100c" class="citation">[100c]</a> woods and mourn,

</blockquote>
<p>Look for it.&nbsp; It applies to this business.&nbsp; Some 
Scotch young folks went out to colonize Darien, and never came 
back.</p>
<blockquote><p>Oh there were white hands wav&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And many a parting hail,<br />
As their vessel stemm&rsquo;d the tide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And stretch&rsquo;d her snowy sail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I remember reading this at Aldbro&rsquo;, and the sound of 
<!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

shell.</p>
<p>Farewell for the present.&nbsp; We shall soon be down amongst 
you.</p>
<p>P.S.&nbsp; I think Northcote drew this picture from life: and 
I have no doubt there is some story attached to it.&nbsp; The 
subject may have been some great malefactor.&nbsp; You know that 
painters like to draw such at times.&nbsp; Northcote could not 
have painted so well but from life.</p>

<i>February</i> 6, 1842.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Frederic</span>,</p>
<p>These fast-following letters of mine seem intended to refute a
charge made against me by Morton: that I had only so much impulse
of correspondence as resulted from the receipt of a 
friend&rsquo;s letter.&nbsp; Is it very frivolous to write all 
these letters, on no business whatsoever?&nbsp; What I think is, 
that one will soon be going into the country, where one hears no 
music, and sees no pictures, and so one will have nothing to 
write about.&nbsp; I mean to take down a Thucydides, to feed on: 
like a whole Parmesan.&nbsp; But at present here I am in London: 
last night I went to see Acis and Galatea brought out, with 
Handel&rsquo;s music, and Stanfield&rsquo;s scenery: really the 
best done thing I have seen for many a year.&nbsp; As I sat alone
(alone in spirit) in the pit, I wished for you: and now Sunday is
over: <!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>I have been to church: I have dined 
at Portland Place: <a name="citation102"></a><a 
href="#footnote102" class="citation">[102]</a> and now I come 
home to my lodgings: light my pipe: and will whisper something 
over to Italy.&nbsp; You talk of your Naples: and that one cannot
understand Theocritus without having been on those shores.&nbsp; 
I tell you, you can&rsquo;t understand Macready without coming to
London and seeing his revival of Acis and Galatea.&nbsp; You 
enter Drury Lane at a quarter to seven: the pit is already nearly
full: but you find a seat, and a very pleasant one.&nbsp; Box 
doors open and shut: ladies take off their shawls and seat 
themselves: gentlemen twist their side curls: the musicians come 
up from under the stage one by one: &rsquo;tis just upon seven: 
Macready is very punctual: Mr. T. Cooke is in his place with his 
marshal&rsquo;s baton in his hand: he lifts it up: and off they 
set with old Handel&rsquo;s noble overture.&nbsp; As it is 
playing, the red velvet curtain (which Macready has substituted, 
not wisely, for the old green one) draws apart: and you see a 
rich drop scene, all festooned and arabesqued with River Gods, 
Nymphs, and their emblems; and in the centre a delightful, large,
good copy of Poussin&rsquo;s great landscape (of which I used to 
have a print in my rooms) where the Cyclops is seen seated on a 
mountain, looking over the sea-shore.&nbsp; The overture ends, 
the drop scene rises, and there is the sea-shore, a long curling 
bay: the sea heaving under the moon, and breaking upon the beach,
and rolling the surf down&mdash;the <!-- page 103--><a 
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
103</span>stage!&nbsp; This is really capitally done.&nbsp; But 
enough of description.&nbsp; The choruses were well sung, well 
acted, well dressed, and well grouped; and the whole thing 
creditable and pleasant.&nbsp; Do you know the music?&nbsp; It is
of Handel&rsquo;s best: and as classical as any man who wore a 
full-bottomed wig could write.&nbsp; I think Handel never gets 
out of his wig: that is, out of his age: his Hallelujah chorus is
a chorus not of angels, but of well-fed earthly choristers, 
ranged tier above tier in a Gothic cathedral, with princes for 
audience, and their military trumpets flourishing over the full 
volume of the organ.&nbsp; Handel&rsquo;s gods are like 
Homer&rsquo;s, and his sublime never reaches beyond the region of
the clouds.&nbsp; Therefore I think that his great marches, 
triumphal pieces, and coronation anthems, are his finest 
works.&nbsp; There is a little bit of Auber&rsquo;s, at the end 
of the Bayad&egrave;re when the God resumes his divinity and 
retires into the sky, which has more of pure light and mystical 
solemnity than anything I know of Handel&rsquo;s: but then this 
is only a scrap: and Auber could not breathe in that atmosphere 
long: whereas old Handel&rsquo;s coursers, with necks with 
thunder clothed and long resounding pace, never tire.&nbsp; 
Beethoven thought more deeply also: but I don&rsquo;t know if he 
could sustain himself so well.&nbsp; I suppose you will resent 
this praise of Beethoven: but you must be tired of the whole 
matter, written as it is in this vile hand: and so here is an end
of it. . . .&nbsp; And now I am going to put on my night-cap: for
my paper is nearly ended, and the iron tongue of St. <!-- page 
104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
104</span>Paul&rsquo;s, as reported by an East wind, has told 
twelve.&nbsp; This is the last news from the city.&nbsp; So Good 
night.&nbsp; I suppose the violets will be going off in the Papal
dominions by the time this letter reaches you: my country cousins
are making much of a few aconites.&nbsp; Love to Morton.</p>
<p>P.S.&nbsp; I hope these foolish letters don&rsquo;t cost you 
and Morton much: I always pay 1<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i> for them 
here: which ought to carry such levities to Hindostan without

<p>I have just got home a new coat for my Constable: which coat 
cost 33 shillings: just the same price as I gave for a 
Chesterfield wrapper (as it is called) for myself some weeks 
ago.&nbsp; People told me I was not improved by my Chesterfield 
wrapper: and I am vext to see how little my Constable is improved
by his coat of Cloth of Gold.&nbsp; But I have been told what is 
the use of a frame lately: only as it requires nice explanation I
shall leave it till I see you.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you wish me to 
buy that little Evening piece I told you of? worth a dozen of 
your Paul Veroneses put together.</p>
<p>When I rate you (as you call it) about shewing my verses, 
letters, etc., you know in what spirit I rate you: thanking you 
all the time for your generous <!-- page 105--><a 
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>intention 
of praising me.&nbsp; It would be very hard, and not desirable, 
to make you understand why my Mama need not have heard the 
verses: but it is a very little matter: so no more of it.&nbsp; 
As to my doing anything else in that way, I know that I could 
write volume after volume as well as others of the mob of 
gentlemen who write with ease: but I think unless a man can do 
better, he had best not do at all; I have not the strong inward 
call, nor cruel-sweet pangs of parturition, that prove the birth 
of anything bigger than a mouse.&nbsp; With you the case is 
different, who have so long been a follower of the Muse, and who 
have had a kindly, sober, English, wholesome, religious spirit 
within you that has communicated kindred warmth to many honest 
souls.&nbsp; Such a creature as Augusta&mdash;John&rsquo;s 
wife&mdash;a true Lady, was very fond of your poems: and I think 
that is no mean praise: a very good assurance that you have not 
written in vain.&nbsp; I am a man of taste, of whom there are 
hundreds born every year: only that less easy circumstances than 
mine at present are compel them to one calling: that calling 
perhaps a mechanical one, which overlies all their other, and 
naturally perhaps more energetic impulses.&nbsp; As to an 
occasional copy of verses, there are few men who have leisure to 
read, and are possessed of any music in their souls, who are not 
capable of versifying on some ten or twelve occasions during 
their natural lives: at a proper conjunction of the stars.&nbsp; 
There is no harm in taking advantage of such occasions.</p>

<p>Your reason for liking your Paul Veronese (what an impudence 
to talk so to a man who has just purchased a real Titian!) does 
not quite disprove my theory.&nbsp; You like the picture because 
you like the verses you once made upon it: you associate the 
picture (naturally enough) with them: and so shall I in future, 
because I like the verses too.&nbsp; But then you ask further, 
what made you write the verses if you were not moved by the 
picture imprimis?&nbsp; Why you know the poetic faculty does 
wonders, as Shakespeare tells us, in imagining the forms of 
things unseen, etc., and so you made a merit where there was 
none: and have liked that merit ever since.&nbsp; But I will not 
disturb you any further in your enjoyment: if you have a vision 
of your own, why should I undo it?</p>
<p>Yesterday I was busily employed in painting over my Opie, 
which had suffered by heat, or something of that kind.&nbsp; I 
borrowed Laurence&rsquo;s palette and brushes and lay upon the 
floor two hours patching over and renovating.&nbsp; The picture 
is really greatly improved, and I am more reconciled to it.&nbsp;
It has now to be varnished: and then I hope some fool will be 
surprised into giving &pound;4 for it, as I did.&nbsp; I have 
selected an advantageous position for it in a dealer&rsquo;s 
shop, just under a rich window that excludes the light.</p>

Twilight: but bring it with me.&nbsp; I like it much, and do not 
repent the purchase.&nbsp; As to the difficulty of bringing down 
so many pictures, I shall travel by the steamer; which will bear 
any quantity.&nbsp; The great new purchase, spoken of in 
yesterday&rsquo;s letter, will also go with me: it will be 
insured at a high valuation before it is entrusted to the Deep, 
of whose treasures I don&rsquo;t at all wish it to become 
one.&nbsp; My Titian is a great hit: if not by him, it is as near
him as ever was painted.&nbsp; But you would not care six straws 
for it.&nbsp; The history of the finest theory of colouring lies 
in those few inches of canvas.&nbsp; But Laurence (who has gone 
for some days into the country) must see it, and tell me about 
it.&nbsp; He is so good a judge, that I ought never to talk till 
I have first heard his verdict.</p>
<p>I was amused at a passage in Clarissa the other day, which 
gives one some idea of what the average state of the arts was 
among the gentry of a hundred years ago.&nbsp; Miss Howe, in 
drawing up a character of her lost Clarissa, says that among 
other things she had a fine taste for the Pencil: had not time to
practise it much, but &lsquo;was an absolute mistress of the 
&ldquo;should be,&rdquo;&rsquo; and then proceeds thus: &lsquo;To
give a familiar instance for the sake of young Ladies: she 
(untaught) observed <i>when but a child</i>, that the Sun, Moon, 
and Stars, never appeared at once: and were therefore never to be
in one piece: that bears, tygers, lions, were not natives of an 
English climate, and should not therefore have a place in an 
English <!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>landscape: that these ravagers of 
the forest consorted not with lambs, kids, or fawns: nor kites, 
hawks, or vultures, with doves, partridges, and 
pheasants.&rsquo;&nbsp; Such was a prodigy in those days.&nbsp; 
It is easy to sneer at this passage: but whoever has read 
anything of the Masques, etc., of James&rsquo;s time, will 
readily recall what absurdities were brought together, even by 
the good Scholars of the day: and therefore will not wonder at 
the imperfect Natural History that was found in young 
Ladies&rsquo; Drawings, and samplers.&nbsp; I remember now to 
have seen wonderful combinations of phenomena in those samplers 
which are occasionally to be found hung up in the parlours of 
Country Inns, and Farm houses.</p>
<p>These letters succeed like the ghosts of Banquo&rsquo;s 
progeny before the eyes of Macbeth.&nbsp; Lucky that time itself 
draws on too close for this letter to &lsquo;hold a glass that

<p>Before the cavalcade and suite of Hardinge&rsquo;s (a 
melancholy procession) reaches you, I think this letter 
will.&nbsp; You need not envy me my purchases, which are 
imprudent ones: both because I can&rsquo;t well afford them, and 
because I have no house to put them.&nbsp; And yet all this gives
a sense of stolen enjoyment to them.&nbsp; I am yet haunted with 
the ghost of a Battle-piece (little in my way) at a shop in 
Holborn: by whom I know not: but so good as to be cheap at 
&pound;4: 10<i>s.</i>, which the man wants for it.&nbsp; My 
Twilight <i>is</i> an upright picture: about a foot wide, and 
rather more than a foot high.</p>
<p>Mr. Browne has declined taking my Opie, unless in conjunction 
with some others which I won&rsquo;t part with: so the Forest 
Girl must set up her stall at a Broker&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I doubt she
will never bring me the money I gave for her.&nbsp; She is the 
only bad speculation of the season.&nbsp; Were she but sold, I 
should be rejoicing in the Holborn Battle Piece.&nbsp; After this
year however I think I shall bid complete adieu to 
picture-<i>hunting</i>: only taking what comes in my way.&nbsp; 
There is a great difference between these two things: both in the
expense of time, thought, and money.&nbsp; Who can sit down to 
Plato while his brains are roaming to Holborn, Christie&rsquo;s,

<p style="text-align: right">[31 <i>March</i>, 1842.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Frederic</span>,</p>
<p>. . . Concerning the bagwigs of composers.&nbsp; 
Handel&rsquo;s was not a bagwig, which was simply so named from 
the little stuffed black silk watch-pocket that hung down behind 
the back of the wearer.&nbsp; Such were Haydn&rsquo;s and 
Mozart&rsquo;s&mdash;much less influential on the character: much
less ostentatious in themselves: not towering so high, nor 
rolling down in following curls so low as to overlay the nature 
of the brain within.&nbsp; But Handel wore the Sir Godfrey 
Kneller wig: greatest of wigs: one of which some great General of
the day used to take off his head after the fatigue of the 
battle, and hand over to his valet to have the bullets combed out
of it.&nbsp; Such a wig was a fugue in itself.&nbsp; I 
don&rsquo;t understand your theory about <!-- page 112--><a 
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>trumpets, 
which have always been so little spiritual <i>in use</i>, that 
they have been the provocatives and celebrators of physical force
from the beginning of the world.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;<i>Power</i>,&rsquo; whether spiritual or physical, is the
meaning of the trumpet: and so, well used, as you say, by Handel 
in his approaches to the Deity.&nbsp; The fugue in the overture 
to the Messiah expresses perhaps the thorny wandering ways of the
world before the voice of the one in the wilderness, and before 
&lsquo;Comfort ye my people, etc.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mozart, I agree 
with you, is the most universal musical genius: Beethoven has 
been too analytical and erudite: but his inspiration is 
nevertheless true.&nbsp; I have just read his Life by Moscheles: 
well worth reading.&nbsp; He shewed no very decided preference 
for music when a child, though he was the son of a composer: and 
I think that he was, strictly speaking, more of a thinker than a 
musician.&nbsp; A great genius he was somehow.&nbsp; He was very 
fond of reading: Plutarch and Shakespeare his great 
favourites.&nbsp; He tried to think in music: almost to reason in
music: whereas perhaps we should be contented with <i>feeling</i>
in it.&nbsp; It can never speak very definitely.&nbsp; There is 
that famous &lsquo;Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty, etc.,&rsquo; in
Handel: nothing can sound more simple and devotional: but it is 
only lately adapted to these words, being originally (I believe) 
a love song in Rodelinda.&nbsp; Well, lovers adore their 
mistresses more than their God.&nbsp; Then the famous music of 
&lsquo;He layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters, 
etc.,&rsquo; was originally fitted <!-- page 113--><a 
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>to an 
Italian pastoral song&mdash;&lsquo;Nasce al bosco in rozza cuna, 
un felice pastorello, etc.&rsquo;&nbsp; That part which seems so 
well to describe &lsquo;and walketh on the wings of the 
wind&rsquo; falls happily in with &lsquo;e con l&rsquo;aura di 
fortuna&rsquo; with which this pastorello sailed along.&nbsp; The
character of the music is ease and largeness: as the shepherd 
lived, so God Almighty walked on the wind.&nbsp; The music 
breathes ease: but words must tell us who takes it easy.&nbsp; 
Beethoven&rsquo;s Sonata&mdash;Op. 14&mdash;is meant to express 
the discord and gradual atonement of two lovers, or a man and his
wife: and he was disgusted that every one did not see what was 
meant: in truth, it expresses any resistance gradually 
overcome&mdash;Dobson shaving with a blunt razor, for 
instance.&nbsp; Music is so far the most universal language, that
any one piece in a particular strain symbolizes all the analogous
phenomena spiritual or material&mdash;if you can talk of 
spiritual phenomena.&nbsp; The Eroica symphony describes the 
battle of the passions as well as of armed men.&nbsp; This is 
long and muddy discourse: but the walls of Charlotte Street 
present little else, especially during this last week of Lent, to
twaddle about.&nbsp; The Cambridge Dons have been up in town for 
the Easter vacation: so we have smoked and talked over Peacock, 
Whewell, etc.&nbsp; Alfred is busy preparing a new volume for the
press: full of doubts, troubles, etc.&nbsp; The reviewers will 
doubtless be at him: and with justice for many things: but some 
of the poems will outlive the reviewers.&nbsp; Trench, 
Wordsworth, Campbell, and Taylor, also appear in new <!-- page

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Tennyson</span>,</p>
<p>I have been long hoping for a letter from you: it has come 
this morning, and repays me for all waiting.&nbsp; While you and 
Morton write to me about Italy I shall never go to see it.&nbsp; 
And yet your account of Cicero&rsquo;s villa, I confess, gives me
a twinge.&nbsp; But of this I am sure: if I saw all these fine 
things with the bodily eye, I should but see them as a scene in a
play, with the additional annoyance of being bitten with fleas 
perhaps, and being in a state of transition which is not suitable
to me: whereas while you see them, and will represent them to me,
I see them through your imagination, and that is better than any 
light of my own.&nbsp; This is very true, I assure you: and you 
and Morton have given me quite a different view of Italy to what 
I had before: a much more enchanting one, but not the more likely
to seduce me into making the false step of trying to realize it 
for myself. . . .&nbsp; In the mean time how tired and bored 
would you be to take one of my travels&mdash;a voyage of eight 
miles from Bedford perhaps&mdash;travelled twenty times 
before&mdash;every winding of the river, every church-spire, 
every country pot house and the quality of its beer, well 
known.&nbsp; No surprise at all.&nbsp; Nil admirari&mdash;I find 
that old Horace <!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>is a good fellow-traveller in 
England: so is Virgil.&nbsp; It is odd that those fellows living 
in the land they did live in should have talked so coldly about 
it.&nbsp; As to Alfred&rsquo;s book, I believe it has sold well: 
but I have not seen him for a long while, and have had no means 
of hearing about the matter except from Thompson, who told me 
that very many copies had been sold at Cambridge, which indeed 
will be the chief market for them.&nbsp; Neither have I seen any 
notice of them in print except that in the Examiner; and that 
seemed so quiet that I scarce supposed it was by Forster.&nbsp; 
Alfred himself is, I believe, in Kent at present.&nbsp; And now, 
my dear Frederic, why do you think of returning to England?&nbsp;
Depend upon it you are better off as you are.&nbsp; You will 
never turn magistrate nor bean-dibbler, nor make yourself of use 
in the country, and therefore why should you not live where you 
like to live best?&nbsp; When I read of your laughing and singing
and riding into Naples with huge self-supplying beakers full of 
the warm South I am sure you had best stay where you are.&nbsp; I
should indeed be very glad to see you again: but then I should 
miss hearing from you: and you would only come here to abuse us 
all and go back again.&nbsp; You Tennysons are born for warm 
climates.&nbsp; As to poor England, I never see a paper, but I 
think with you that she is on the go.&nbsp; I used to dread this:
but somehow I now contemplate it as a necessary thing, and, till 
the shoe begins to <!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>pinch me sorely, walk on with some 
indifference.&nbsp; It seems impossible the manufacturers can go 
on as they are: and impossible that the demand for our goods can 
continue as of old in Europe: and impossible but that we must get
a rub and licking in some of our colonies: and if all these 
things come at once, why then the devil&rsquo;s in it.&nbsp; I 
used to think as you do about France and the French: and we all 
agreed in London that France should be divided among the other 
powers as Poland was: but Donne has given me pause: he says that 
France is the great counteracting democratic principle to 
Russia.&nbsp; This may be: though I think Russia is too unwieldly
and rotten-ripe ever to make a huge progress in conquest.&nbsp; 
What is to be thought of a nation where the upper classes speak 
the language of another country, and have varnished over their 
honest barbarism with the poorest French profligacy and 
intrigue?&nbsp; Russia does not seem a whole to me.&nbsp; In the 
mean time, all goes on toward better and better, as is my firm 
belief: and humanity grows clear by flowing, (very little 
profited by any single sage or hero), and man shall have wings to
fly and something much better than that in the end. . . .</p>
<p>I draw a very little, and think of music as I walk in the 
fields: but have no piano in this part of the world. . . .&nbsp; 
I hear there is a fine new Symphony by Mendelssohn, who is by far
our best writer now, and in some measure combines Beethoven and 
Handel.&nbsp; I grow every day more and more to love only the 
<!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
121</span>old God save the King style: the common chords, those 
truisms of music, like other truisms so little understood in the 
full.&nbsp; Just look at the mechanism of Robin Adair.</p>

know how much I rejoice in your letters.</p>

<p>Your letter reached me this morning and gave me much 
pleasure.&nbsp; An old acquaintance is not the <!-- page 123--><a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>worse for 
its wear, I think.&nbsp; This very time ten years ago we were in 
Wales together: I at Mr. Rees&rsquo; boarding-house at Tenby: and
there I made chance acquaintance with the whiskered man <a 
name="citation123"></a><a href="#footnote123" 
class="citation">[123]</a> at whose house I am now 
staying:&mdash;then a boy of sixteen.&nbsp; He is now a man of 
business, of town-politics, and more intent on the first of 
September than on anything else in the world.&nbsp; I see very 
little of him. . . .</p>
<p>I occasionally read sentences about the Virtues out of this 
collection of Stob&aelig;us, and look into Sartor Resartus, which
has fine things in it: and a little Dante and a little 
Shakespeare.&nbsp; But the great secret of all is the not eating 
meat.&nbsp; To that the world must come, I am sure.&nbsp; Only it
makes one grasshopper foolish.&nbsp; I also receive letters from 
Morton and F. Tennyson full of fine accounts of Italy, finer than
any I ever read.&nbsp; They came all of a sudden on 
Cicero&rsquo;s villa&mdash;one of them at least, the 
Formian&mdash;with a mosaic pavement leading thro&rsquo; lemon 
gardens down to the sea, and a little fountain as old as the 
Augustan age bubbling up as fresh, Tennyson says, &lsquo;as when 
its silver sounds mixed with the deep voice of the orator as he 
sate there in the stillness of the noon day, devoting the 
siesta-hours to study.&rsquo;&nbsp; When I first read of these 
things I wish to see them; but, on reflection, I am sure I see 
them much better in such letters as these.</p>
<p>I have seen one good picture about here: a <!-- page 124--><a 
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>portrait of
O. Cromwell by Lely&mdash;so said&mdash;unlike other Lelys, but 
very carefully painted: and, I should think, an original 
portrait. . .&nbsp; I also read Hayley&rsquo;s Life of Romney the
other day.&nbsp; Romney wanted but education and reading to make 
him a very fine painter: but his ideal was not high nor 
fixed.&nbsp; How touching is the close of his life!&nbsp; He 
married at nineteen, and, because Sir Joshua and others had said 
that marriage spoilt an artist, almost immediately left his wife 
in the North, and scarce saw her till the end of his life: when, 
old, nearly mad, and quite desolate, he went back to her, and she
received him, and nursed him till he died.&nbsp; This quiet act 
of hers is worth all Romney&rsquo;s pictures; even as a matter of
Art, I am sure.</p>
<p>Whether this letter will ever reach you, I don&rsquo;t

<p>On the 15th of September 1842 FitzGerald first made 
Carlyle&rsquo;s personal acquaintance.&nbsp; He always spoke of 
his having first gone to Chelsea in company with Thackeray, and 
in the Notes which he left of his excavations at Naseby he 
repeats what he frequently told myself and others.&nbsp; But his 
memory was clearly at fault, for in a letter to Pollock, written 
on the 16th, but dated by mistake the 17th, of September, he 
says, &lsquo;I have come up to London for two days on a false 
errand: and am therefore going back in a pet, to Naseby. . . 
.&nbsp; I enquired at Spedding&rsquo;s rooms to-day: he is 
expected by the 20th, which is near.&nbsp; Laurence is the only 
person I know in town. . . .&nbsp; He and I went to see Carlyle 
at Chelsea yesterday.&nbsp; That genius has been surveying the 
field of battle of Naseby in company with Dr. Arnold, who died 
soon after, poor man!&nbsp; I doubt (from Carlyle&rsquo;s 
description) if they identified the very ground of the carnage. .
. .&nbsp; I have heard nothing of Thackeray for these two 
months.&nbsp; He was to have visited an Irish brother of mine: 
but he has not yet done so.&nbsp; I called at Coram Street 
yesterday, and old John seemed to think he was yet in 
Ireland.&rsquo;&nbsp; With this correction I <!-- page 126--><a 
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>now give 
the Memorandum referred to, which FitzGerald entrusted to my 
keeping together with several of Carlyle&rsquo;s letters.&nbsp; 
An attempt to put up a monument on the real site of the battle 
proved abortive, as will appear hereafter.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;About the middle of September 1842, W. M. 
Thackeray took me to tea with Carlyle whom I had not previously 
known.&nbsp; He was then busy with Cromwell; had just been, he 
told us, over the Field of Naseby in company with Dr. Arnold of 
Rugby, and had sufficiently identified the Ground of the Battle 
with the contemporaneous Accounts of it.&nbsp; As I happened to 
know the Field well&mdash;the greater part of it then belonging 
to my Family&mdash;I knew that Carlyle and Arnold had been 
mistaken&mdash;misled in part by an Obelisk which my Father had 
set up as on the highest Ground of the Field, but which they 
mistook for the centre-ground of the Battle.&nbsp; This I told 
Carlyle, who was very reluctant to believe that he and Arnold 
could have been deceived&mdash;that he could accept no hearsay 
Tradition or Theory against the Evidence of his own Eyes, 
etc.&nbsp; However, as I was just then going down to Naseby, I 
might enquire further into the matter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;On arriving at Naseby, I had spade and mattock taken to
a hill near half a mile across from the &ldquo;Blockhead 
Obelisk,&rdquo; and pitted with several hollows, overgrown with 
rank Vegetation, which Tradition had always pointed to as the 
Graves of the Slain.&nbsp; One of <!-- page 127--><a 
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>these I had
opened; and there, sure enough, were the remains of Skeletons 
closely packed together&mdash;chiefly teeth&mdash;but some 
remains of Shinbone, and marks of Skull in the Clay.&nbsp; Some 
of these, together with some sketches of the Place, I sent to 
Carlyle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Naseby Monument, already advised by Carlyle, was 
not executed at the time: and some how or other was not again 
talked of till 1855 when the Estate was to be sold from us.&nbsp;
I was told however by the Lawyers, etc., that it was better not 
to interfere while that Business was going on.&nbsp; So the 
Scheme went to sleep again till 1872, when, Carlyle renewing the 
subject in some Letter, I applied to the Agent of the Estate who 
was willing to help us in getting permission to erect the Stone, 
and to a neighbouring Mason to fashion it as Carlyle 
desired.&nbsp; We had some difficulty in this latter point, but 
at last all was settled, when suddenly Agent and Lawyer informed 
us the thing must not be done&mdash;for one reason, that Stone 
and Inscription were considered too plain.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before the excavations were begun, however, FitzGerald 
received the following letter of instructions from Carlyle, 
written three days after their interview.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Chelsea</span>, 
18 <i>Sept</i>., 1842.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>Profiting by the unexpected fact that <i>you</i> are now 
master of Naseby Battlefield, I have gone over the whole matter 
once more, probably for the twentieth time; I <!-- page 128--><a 
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>have copied
you my illegible pencil-notes, and re-verified 
everything,&mdash;that so, if you can understand the meaning 
(which will be difficult, I fear), you may append to it what 
commentary, collected on the spot, you may judge edifying.&nbsp; 
Let me, however, again impress upon you that these statements and
descriptions are actual <i>facts</i>, gathered with industry from
some seven or eight eyewitnesses, looking at the business with 
their own eyes from seven or eight different sides; that the 
present figure of the ground, in my recollection, corresponds 
very tolerably well with the whole of them;&mdash;and that no 
&lsquo;theory,&rsquo; by what Professor soever, can be of any use
to me in comparison.&nbsp; I wish you had Sprigge&rsquo;s 
complete Plan of the Battle: but you have it not; you have only 
that foolish Parson&rsquo;s <a name="citation128"></a><a 
href="#footnote128" class="citation">[128]</a> very dim copy of 
it, and must help yourself with that.</p>
<p>The things I wish you to give me are first: The whole story of
your Blacksmith, or other oral Chronicler, be it wise and 
credible, be it absurd and evidently false.&nbsp; Then you can 
ask, whether there remains any tradition of a windmill at 
Naseby?&nbsp; One stands in the Plan, not far from North of the 
village, probably some 300 yards to the west of where the ass of 
a column now stands: the whole concern, of fighting, rallying, 
flying, killing and chasing, transacted itself to the <i>west</i>
of that,&mdash;on the height, over the brow of the height, down 
the slope, in the hollow, and up again to the grounds of Dust 
Hill, where the <i>final</i> dispersion took place.&nbsp; 
Therefore, again, pray ask.</p>
<p>Where precisely any dead bodies are known to have <!-- page 
129--><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
129</span>been found?&nbsp; Where and when the <i>last</i>-found 
was come upon; what they made of it,&mdash;whether no Antiquarian
kept a tooth; at any rate, a button or the like?&nbsp; 
Cannon-balls ought to be found, especially musket-balls, down in 
that hollow, and on the slope thitherward: is any extant cabinet 
master of one?</p>
<p>Farther, are there, on the high ground N.W. or W. of Naseby 
village, any traces still discoverable of such names as these: 
&lsquo;Lantford hedges&rsquo; (or perhaps &lsquo;hedge&rsquo;); a
kind of thicket running <i>up</i> the slope, towards the western 
environs of Naseby village, nearly from the North;&mdash;Fairfax 
had dragoons hidden here, who fired upon Rupert&rsquo;s right, as
he charged upwards: &lsquo;Rutput Hill&rsquo;: &lsquo;Fanny 
Hill&rsquo; (according to Rushworth, &lsquo;Famny Hill&rsquo; in 
Sprigge),&mdash;probably two swellings in the ground, that lie 
between the south end of Lantford Hedges and the village; 
&lsquo;Lean Leaf Hill&rsquo; seemingly another swelling, parallel
to these, which reaches in with its slope <i>to</i> the very 
village&mdash;from the west: &lsquo;Mill Hill&rsquo; farther to 
the east (marked as due west from the windmill, which of course 
must have stood upon a part of it), lying therefore upon the 
north part of the village?&nbsp; Is it possible, in spite of all 
ditching and enclosure bills, there may still some vestige of 
these names adhere to some fields or messuages; the exact 
position of which it would be satisfactory to fix.&nbsp; You can 
also tell me whether Burrough Hill is visible from Naseby, and 
&lsquo;what it is like&rsquo;; and what the Sibbertoft height, on
the other side, and the Harboro&rsquo; Height are like!&nbsp; I 
suppose one sees Sibbertoft steeple, but no houses, from Naseby 
Height?&nbsp; Also that it was undoubtedly Clipston (as the good 
Dr. Arnold and I supposed) that we saw <!-- page 130--><a 
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
130</span>there.&nbsp; Dr. A. and I came, as I find, thro&rsquo; 
Crick, West Hadden, Cold Ashby; and crossed the Welford and 
Northampton road, perhaps some three miles from Naseby.</p>
<p>On the whole, my dear Sir, here seems to be work enough for 
you!&nbsp; But after all is it not worth your while on other 
accounts?&nbsp; Were it not a most legitimate task for the 
Proprietor of Naseby, a man of scholarship, intelligence and 
leisure, to make himself completely acquainted with the true 
state of all details connected with Naseby Battle and its 
localities?&nbsp; Few spots of ground in all the world are 
memorabler to an Englishman.&nbsp; We could still very well stand
a good little book on Naseby!&nbsp; <i>Verbum sapienti</i>.</p>
<p>As for myself, had I the wings of an eagle, most likely I 
should still fly to you, and to several other quarters; but with 
railways and tub-gigs, and my talent for insomnolence, and 
fretting myself to fiddlestrings with all terrestrial locomotion 
whatsoever&mdash;alas, alas!</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Believe me always,<br />
My dear Sir,<br />
Very truly yours<br />
<span class="smcap">T. Carlyle</span>.</p>
<p>FitzGerald&rsquo;s letter to Carlyle, giving an account of the
first results of his excavations, has apparently not been 
preserved, but it was promptly acknowledged.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Chelsea</span>, 
<i>Saturday</i>, 25 [24] <i>Septr</i>., 1842.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>You will do me and the Genius of History a real favour, if you
persist in these examinations and excavations <!-- page 131--><a 
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>to the 
utmost length possible for you!&nbsp; It is long since I read a 
letter so interesting as yours of yesterday.&nbsp; Clearly enough
you are upon the very battle-ground;&mdash;and I, it is also 
clear, have only looked up towards it from the slope of Mill 
Hill.&nbsp; Were not the weather so wet, were not, etc., etc., so
many <i>etceteras</i>, I could almost think of running up to join
you still!&nbsp; But that is evidently unfeasible at present.</p>
<p>The opening of that burial-heap blazes strangely in my 
thoughts: these are the very jawbones that were clenched together
in deadly rage, on this very ground, 197 years ago!&nbsp; It 
brings the matter home to one, with a strange veracity,&mdash;as 
if for the first time one saw it to be no fable and theory but a 
dire fact.&nbsp; I will beg for a tooth and a bullet; 
authenticated by your own eyes and word of honour!&mdash;Our 
Scotch friend too, making turnip manure of it, he is part of the 
Picture.&nbsp; I understand almost all the Netherlands 
battlefields have already given up their bones to British 
husbandly; why not the old English next?&nbsp; Honour to 
thrift.&nbsp; If of 5000 wasted men, you can make a few usable 
turnips, why, do it!</p>
<p>The more sketches and details you can contrive to send me, the
better.&nbsp; I want to know for one thing whether there is any 
<i>house</i> on Cloisterwell; what house that was that I saw from
the slope of Naseby height (Mill-hill, I suppose), and fancied to
be Dust Hill Farm?&nbsp; It must lie about North by West from 
Naseby Church, perhaps near a mile off.&nbsp; You say, one cannot
see Dust Hill at all, much less any farm house of Dust Hill, from
that Naseby Height?</p>
<p>But why does the Obelisk stand there?&nbsp; It might as well 
stand at Charing Cross; the blockhead that it is!&nbsp; I <!-- 
page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
132</span>again wish I had wings: alas, I wish many things; that 
the gods would but annihilate Time and Space, which would include
all things!</p>
<p>In great haste, Yours most truly,</p>

<p>The following letters will partly supply the place of the 
missing letter to Carlyle.</p>

[16] 1842.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Barton</span>,</p>
<p>Have you supposed me dead or what?&nbsp; Well, so far from it,
I have grown more fat than ever, which is quite as much reason 
for not writing.&nbsp; I have been staying at Naseby, and, having
come up here for two days, return to that place by railroad 
to-morrow.&nbsp; I went to see Carlyle last night.&nbsp; He had 
just returned from the neighbourhood of Bury.&nbsp; He is full of
Cromwell, and, funny enough, went over from Rugby to Naseby this 
spring with poor Dr. Arnold.&nbsp; They saw nothing, and walked 
over what was not the field of battle.&nbsp; I want him to go 
down with me: but he thinks it would be too expensive.&nbsp; So I
have engaged to collect what matter I can for him on the 
spot.&nbsp; At the beginning of October I expect to be back in 
East Anglia for the winter.&nbsp; Frail is human virtue.&nbsp; I 
thought I had quite got over picture dealing, when lo! walking in
Holborn this day I looked into a shop just to shew the strength 
of my virtue, and fell.&nbsp; That <!-- page 133--><a 
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>accursed 
Battle Piece&mdash;I have bought it&mdash;and another picture of 
dead chaffinches, which Mr. C[hurchyard] will like, it is so well
done: I expect you to give high prices for these 
pictures&mdash;mind that: and begin to economize in household 
matters.&nbsp; Leave off sugar in tea and make all your household
do so.&nbsp; Also write to me at Naseby, Welford, 
Northampton.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my direction&mdash;such a 
glorious country, Barton.&nbsp; I wrote you a letter a week ago, 
but never posted it.&nbsp; So now goodbye.&nbsp; I shall bring 
down the Chaffinches with me to Suffolk.&nbsp; Trade has been 
very bad, the dealers tell me.&nbsp; My fruit Girl still hangs up
at a window&mdash;an unpleasant sight.&nbsp; Nobody is so hard 
set as to bid for her.</p>

<p>. . . London was very close and nasty: so I am glad to get 
down here: where, however, I am not (as at present proposed) to 
stay long: my Father requiring my services in Suffolk early in 
October.&nbsp; Laurence has made a sort of promise to come and 
see me here next Saturday: I wanted him to come down with me 
while the weather was fine.&nbsp; The place is very desert, but a
battle was probably fought here 200 years ago, as an Obelisk 
planted by my Papa on the wrong site intimates.&nbsp; Poor 
Carlyle got into sad error from that deluding Obelisk: which 
Liston used to call (in this <!-- page 134--><a 
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>case with 
truth) an Obstacle.&nbsp; I am afraid Carlyle will make a mad 
mess of Cromwell and his Times: what a poor figure Fairfax will 
cut!&nbsp; I am very tired of these heroics; and I can worship no
man who has but a square inch of brains more than myself.&nbsp; I
think there is but one Hero: and that is the Maker of Heroes.</p>
<p>Here I am reading Virgil&rsquo;s delightful Georgics for the 
first time.&nbsp; They really attune perfectly well with the 
plains and climate of Naseby.&nbsp; Valpy (whose edition I have) 
cannot quite follow Virgil&rsquo;s plough&mdash;in its 
construction at least.&nbsp; But the main acts of agriculture 
seem to have changed very little, and the alternation of green 
and corn crops is a good dodge.&nbsp; And while I heard the 
fellows going out with their horses to plough as I sat at 
breakfast this morning, I also read&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Libra die somnique pares ubi fecerit horas,<br />
Et medium luci atque umbris jam dividit orbem,<br />

<p>The pictures are left all ready packed up in Portland Place, 
and shall come down with me, whenever <!-- page 135--><a 
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>that 
desirable event takes place.&nbsp; In the mean while here I am as
before: but having received a long and interesting letter from 
Carlyle asking information about this Battle field, I have 
trotted about rather more to ascertain names of places, 
positions, etc.&nbsp; After all he will make a mad book.&nbsp; I 
have just seen some of the bones of a dragoon and his horse who 
were found foundered in a morass in the field&mdash;poor dragoon,
much dismembered by time: his less worthy members having been 
left in the owner&rsquo;s summer-house for the last twenty years 
have disappeared one by one: but his skull is kept safe in the 
hall: not a bad skull neither: and in it some teeth yet holding, 
and <i>a bit of the iron heel of his boot</i>, put into the skull
by way of convenience.&nbsp; This is what Sir Thomas Browne calls
&lsquo;making a man act his Antipodes.&rsquo; <a 
name="citation135"></a><a href="#footnote135" 
class="citation">[135]</a>&nbsp; I have got a fellow to dig at 
one of the great general graves in the field: and he tells me 
to-night that he has come to bones: to-morrow I will select a 
neat specimen or two.&nbsp; In the mean time let the full harvest
moon wonder at them as they lie turned up after lying hid 2400 
revolutions of hers.&nbsp; Think of that warm 14th of June when 
the Battle was fought, and they fell pell-mell: and then the 
country people came and buried them so shallow that the stench 
was terrible, and the putrid matter oozed over the ground for 
several yards: so that the cattle were <!-- page 136--><a 
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>observed to
eat those places very close for some years after.&nbsp; Every one
to his taste, as one might well say to any woman who kissed the 
cow that pastured there.</p>
<p>Friday, 23rd.&nbsp; We have dug at a place, as I said, and 
made such a trench as would hold a dozen fellows: whose remains 
positively make up the mould.&nbsp; The bones nearly all rotted 
away, except the teeth which are quite good.&nbsp; At the bottom 
lay the <i>form</i> of a perfect skeleton: most of the bones 
gone, but the pressure distinct in the clay: the thigh and leg 
bones yet extant: the skull a little pushed forward, as if there 
were scanty room.&nbsp; We also tried some other reputed graves, 
but found nothing: indeed it is not easy to distinguish what are 
graves from old marl-pits, etc.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care for all 
this bone-rummaging myself: but the identification of the graves 
identifies also where the greatest heat of the battle was.&nbsp; 
Do you wish for a tooth?</p>
<p>As I began this antiquarian account in a letter to you, so I 
have finished it, that you may mention it to my Papa, who perhaps
will be amused at it.&nbsp; Two farmers insisted on going out 
exploring with me all day: one a very solid fellow, who talks 
like the justices in Shakespeare: but who certainly was inspired 
in finding out this grave: the other a Scotchman full of 
intelligence, who proposed the flesh-soil for manure for 
turnips.&nbsp; The old Vicar, whose age reaches halfway back to 
the day of the Battle, stood tottering over the verge of the 
trench.&nbsp; Carlyle has shewn <!-- page 137--><a 
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>great 
sagacity in guessing at the localities from the vague 
descriptions of contemporaries: and his short <i>pasticcio</i> of
the battle is the best I have seen. <a name="citation137"></a><a 
href="#footnote137" class="citation">[137]</a>&nbsp; But he will 
spoil all by making a demi-god of Cromwell, who certainly was so 
far from wise that he brought about the very thing he fought to 
prevent&mdash;the restoration of an unrestricted monarchy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Laurence</span>,</p>
<p>I am sorry you did not come, as the weather has become fine, 
and this wild wide country looks well on these blowing days, with
flying shadows running over the distance.&nbsp; Carlyle wrote me 
a long letter of questions concerning the field of Battle, its 
traditions, etc.&nbsp; So I have trotted about, examined the 
natives, and answered a great many of his queries as fully, but 
as shortly, as I could.&nbsp; However I suppose he growls 
superciliously at my letter, which was necessarily rather a long 
one.&nbsp; I have also, in company with two farmers, opened one 
of the reputed graves in which the killed were said to be 
reposited: and there sure enough we found decayed bones, skulls, 
arms, legs, etc., and very sound teeth&mdash;the only sound 
part.&nbsp; For many bodies put together corrupt one another of 
course, and 200 years have not contributed <!-- page 138--><a

preservation.&nbsp; People had often dug about the field before 
and found nothing; and we tried two or three other spots with no 
success.&nbsp; I am going to dig once more in a place where 
tradition talks of a large burial of men and horses. . . .</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t trouble yourself to write answers to my

five clergymen to officiate: two in shovel-hats.&nbsp; Our Vicar 
is near ninety; we have two curates: and an old Clergyman and his
Archdeacon son came on a visit.&nbsp; The son having a 
shovel-hat, of course the Father could not be left behind.&nbsp; 
Shovel-hats (you know) came into use with the gift of Tongs.</p>

<p>. . . Do you know that I am really going to look out for some 
permanent abode, which I think I am well qualified to decide on 
now.&nbsp; But in this very judgment I may be most of all 
mistaken.&nbsp; I do not love London enough to pitch my tent

<p>I have been reading Burton&rsquo;s Anatomy <a

class="citation">[139]</a> lately: a captivating book 
certainly.&nbsp; That story of his going to the bridge at Oxford 
to listen to the bargemen&rsquo;s slang, etc., he reports of the 
old Democritus, his prototype: so perhaps biographers thought it 
must be Burton&rsquo;s taste also.&nbsp; Or perhaps Burton took 
to doing it after example.&nbsp; I cannot help fancying that I 
see the foundation (partly) of Carlyle&rsquo;s style in Burton: 
one passage quite like part of Sartor Resartus.&nbsp; Much of 
Barton&rsquo;s Biography may be picked up out of his own 
introduction to the Anatomy.&nbsp; Maurice&rsquo;s Introductory

the same as ever.&nbsp; &lsquo;Repeal&rsquo; is faintly chalked

collection of pictures by the Royal Academy: among them old 
unsaleables by Maclise and Uwins.</p>
<p>What I write for however is to say that the first volume of 
Titmarsh&rsquo;s Ireland is at 39 Portland Place; and that I wish

<p>. . . You would rave at this climate which is wetter far than 
that of England.&nbsp; There are the Wicklow hills (mountains we 
call them) in the offing&mdash;quite high enough.&nbsp; In spite 
of my prejudice for a level, I find myself every day 
unconsciously verging <!-- page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span

the freest view of their blue ranges.&nbsp; One&rsquo;s thoughts 
take wing to the distance.&nbsp; I fancy that moderately high

by Mont Blancs, etc.&nbsp; But this may be only a passing 
prejudice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Frederic</span>,</p>
<p>Either you wrote me word yourself, or some one told me, that 
you meant to winter at Florence.&nbsp; So I shall direct to the 
Poste Restante there.&nbsp; You see I am not settled at the 
Florence of Suffolk, called Ipswich, yet: but I am perhaps as 
badly off; being in this most dull country house quite alone; a 
grey mist, that seems teeming with half formed snow, all over the
landscape before my windows.&nbsp; It is also Sunday morning: ten
of the clock by the chime now sounding from the stables.&nbsp; I 
have fed on bread and milk (a dreadfully opaque diet) and I await
the <!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>morning Church in humble hope.&nbsp;
It will begin in half an hour.&nbsp; We keep early hours in the 
country.&nbsp; So you will be able exactly to measure my aptitude
and fullness for letter writing by the quantity written now, 
before I bolt off for hat, gloves, and prayerbook.&nbsp; I always
put on my thickest great coat to go to our Church in: as fungi 
grow in great numbers about the communion table.&nbsp; And now, 
to turn away from Boulge, I must tell you that I went up to 
London a month ago to see old Thackeray, who had come there to 
have his eyes doctored.&nbsp; I stayed with him ten days and we 
were as usual together.&nbsp; Alfred came up &lsquo;in 
transitu&rsquo; from Boxley to Cheltenham; he looked, and said he
was, ill: I have never seen him so hopeless: and I am really 
anxious to know how he is. . . .&nbsp; I remember the days of the
summer when you and I were together, quarrelling and 
laughing&mdash;these I remember with pleasure.&nbsp; Our trip to 
Gravesend has left a perfume with me.&nbsp; I can get up with you
on that everlastingly stopping coach on which we tried to travel 
from Gravesend to Maidstone that Sunday morning: worn out with 
it, we got down at an inn, and then got up on another 
coach&mdash;and an old smiling fellow passed us holding out his 
hat&mdash;and you said, &lsquo;That old fellow must go about as 
Homer did&rsquo;&mdash;and numberless other turns of road and 
humour, which sometimes pass before me as I lie in bed. . . 
.&nbsp; Now before I turn over, I will go and see about Church, 
as I hear no bell, pack myself up as warmly as I can, and be 
off.&nbsp; So good-bye till twelve 
o&rsquo;clock.&mdash;&rsquo;Tis <!-- page 146--><a 
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>five 
minutes past twelve by the stable clock: so I saw as I returned 
from Church through the garden.&nbsp; Parson and Clerk got 
through the service see saw like two men in a sawpit.&nbsp; In 
the garden I see the heads of the snowdrops and crocuses just out
of the earth.&nbsp; Another year with its same flowers and topics
to open upon us.&nbsp; Shenstone somewhere sings, <a 
name="citation146a"></a><a href="#footnote146a"

<blockquote><p>Tedious again to mark the drizzling day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Again to trace the same sad tracts of snow:<br />
Or, lull&rsquo;d by vernal airs, again survey<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The selfsame hawthorn bud, and cowslips blow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I rely on you and all your family sympathizing in this.&nbsp; 
So do I sometimes: anyhow, people complimenting each other on the
approach of Spring and such like felicitations are very 
tiresome.&nbsp; Our very year is of a paltry diameter.&nbsp; But 
this is not proper language for Mark Tapley, whose greatest bore 
just now is having a bad pen; but the letter is ended.&nbsp; So 
he is jolly and yours as ever.</p>

<p>I hope you got safe and sound to London: as I did to this 
place yesterday.&nbsp; Those good Tetter people!&nbsp; I have got
an attachment to them somehow.&nbsp; I left Jane <a 
name="citation146b"></a><a href="#footnote146b" 
class="citation">[146b]</a> in a turmoil as to which picture of 
<!-- page 147--><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
147</span>W[ilkinson] she was to take.&nbsp; I advised her to 
take a dose of Time, which always operates so gently.</p>
<p>I have been down to Woodbridge to-day and had a long chat with
Churchyard, whom I wish you had seen, as also his Gainsborough 
sketches.&nbsp; He is quite clear as to Gainsborough&rsquo;s 
general method, which was (he says) to lay all in (except the 
sky, of course) with pure colour, quite unmixed with white.&nbsp;
The sketch he has is certainly so; but whether it ever could have
been wrought up into a deep finish, I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; C. 
says yes it could: that Gainsborough began nearly all his 
pictures so.&nbsp; He has tried it over and over again (he says) 
and produced exactly the same effect with pure colour, laid on 
very thin over a light brown ground: asphaltum and blue producing
just such a green as many of the trees in this sketch are 
of.&nbsp; The sky put in afterwards.</p>
<p>He thinks this the great secret of landscape painting.&nbsp; 
He shewed me the passage quoted by Burnet <a 
name="citation147"></a><a href="#footnote147" 
class="citation">[147]</a> from Rubens&rsquo; maxims (where and 
what are they?)&nbsp; &lsquo;Begin by painting in your shadows 
lightly, taking care that <i>no</i> white be suffered to glide 
into them&mdash;<i>it is the poison of a picture except in the 
lights</i>.&nbsp; If ever your shadows are corrupted by the 
introduction of this baneful colour, your tones will no longer be
warm and transparent, but heavy and leaden.&nbsp; It is not the 
same in the lights: they may be loaded with colour as much as you
think proper.&rsquo;</p>

no artist, and very ignorant, as you think, I dare say.&nbsp; Try
a head in this way.&nbsp; You have tried a dozen, you say.&nbsp; 
Very well then.</p>
<p>I will send up your cloak, which is barely bigger than a fig 
leaf, when I can.&nbsp; On Saturday I give supper to B. Barton 
and Churchyard.&nbsp; I wish you could be with us.&nbsp; We are 
the chief wits of Woodbridge.&nbsp; And one man has said that he

<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Of FitzGerald&rsquo;s way of life at this time I have the 
following notes which were given me by the late Rev. George 
Crabbe, Rector of Merton, the grandson of the poet, at whose 
house he died.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;FitzGerald was living at Boulge Cottage 
when I first knew him: a thatched cottage of one storey just 
outside his Father&rsquo;s Park.&nbsp; No one was, I think, 
resident at the Hall.&nbsp; His mother would sometimes be there a
short time, and would drive about in a coach and four black 
horses.&nbsp; This would be in 1844, when he was 36.&nbsp; He 
used to walk by himself, slowly, with a Skye terrier.&nbsp; I was
rather afraid of him.&nbsp; He seemed a proud and very 
punctilious man.&nbsp; I think he was at this time going often of
an evening to Bernard Barton&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He did not come to 
us, except occasionally, till 1846.&nbsp; He seemed to me when I 
first saw him much as he was when he died, only not stooping: 
always like a grave middle-aged man: <!-- page 149--><a 
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>never 
seemed very happy or light-hearted, though his conversation was 
most amusing sometimes.&nbsp; His cottage was a mile from 
Bredfield.&nbsp; He was very fond, I think, of my Father; though 
they had several coolnesses which I believe were all my 
Father&rsquo;s fault, who took fancies that people disliked him 
or were bored by him.&nbsp; E. F. G. had in his cottage an old 
woman to wait on him, Mrs. Faiers; a very old-fashioned Suffolk 
woman.&nbsp; He was just as careful not to make her do anything 
as he was afterwards with Mrs. Howe. <a name="citation149"></a><a
href="#footnote149" class="citation">[149]</a>&nbsp; He would 
never ring the bell, if there was one, of which I am not 
sure.&nbsp; Sometimes he would give a little dinner&mdash;my 
Father, Brooke, B. Barton, Churchyard&mdash;everything most 
hospitable, but not comfortable.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In 1846 and 1847 he does not seem to have come much to 
Bredfield.&nbsp; Perhaps he was away a good deal.&nbsp; He was 
often away, visiting his mother, or W. Browne, or in London, or 
at the Kerriches&rsquo;.&nbsp; In 1848, 1849, and 1850 he was a 
great deal at Bredfield, generally dropping in about seven 
o&rsquo;clock, singing glees with us, and then joining my Father 
over his cigar, and staying late and often sleeping.&nbsp; He 
very often arranged concerted pieces for us to sing, in four 
parts, he being tenor.&nbsp; He sang very accurately but had not 
a good voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;While E. F. G. was at Boulge, he always got up early, 
eat his small breakfast, stood at his desk reading or writing all
the morning, eat his dinner of vegetables <!-- page 150--><a 
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>and 
pudding, walked with his Skye terrier, and then often finished 
the day by spending the evening with us or the Bartons.&nbsp; He 
did not visit with the neighbouring gentlefolks, as he hated a 
set dinner party.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I got your letter all right.&nbsp; But you did not tell me 
where to direct to you again; so I must send to the Poste 
Restante at Florence.&nbsp; I have also heard from Morton, to 
whom I despatched a letter yesterday: and now set about one to 
you.&nbsp; As you live in two different cities, one may write 
about the same things to both.&nbsp; You told me of the Arno 
being frozen, and even Italian noses being cold: he tells me the 
Spring is coming.&nbsp; I tell you that we have had the mildest 
winter known; but as good weather, when it does come in England, 
is always unseasonable, and as an old proverb says that a green 
Yule makes a fat kirk-yard, so it has been with us: the 
extraordinary fine season has killed heaps of people with 
influenza, debilitated others for their lives long, worried 
everybody with colds, etc.&nbsp; I have had three influenzas: but
this is no wonder: for I live in a hut with walls as thin as a 
sixpence: windows that don&rsquo;t shut: a clay soil safe beneath
my feet: a thatch perforated by lascivious sparrows over my 
head.&nbsp; Here I sit, read, <!-- page 151--><a 
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>smoke, and 
become very wise, and am already quite beyond earthly 
things.&nbsp; I must say to you, as Basil Montagu once said, in 
perfect charity, to his friends: &lsquo;You see, my dear fellows,
I like you very much, but I continue to advance, and you remain 
where you are (you see), and so I shall be obliged to leave you 
behind me.&nbsp; It is no fault of mine.&rsquo;&nbsp; You must 
begin to read Seneca, whose letters I have been reading: else, 
when you come back to England, you will be no companion to a man 
who despises wealth, death, etc.&nbsp; What are pictures but 
paintings&mdash;what are auctions but sales!&nbsp; All is 
vanity.&nbsp; Erige animum tuum, m&icirc; Lucili, etc.&nbsp; I 
wonder whether old Seneca was indeed such a humbug as people now 
say he was: he is really a fine writer.&nbsp; About three hundred
years ago, or less, our divines and writers called him the divine
Seneca; and old Bacon is full of him.&nbsp; One sees in him the 
upshot of all the Greek philosophy, how it stood in Nero&rsquo;s 
time, when the Gods had worn out a good deal.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
think old Seneca believed he should live again.&nbsp; Death is 
his great resource.&nbsp; Think of the <i>rocococity</i> of a 
gentleman studying Seneca in the middle of February 1844 in a 
remarkably damp cottage.</p>
<p>I have heard from Alfred also, who hates his water 
life&mdash;&beta;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf; 
&alpha;&beta;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf; he calls it&mdash;but hopes 
to be cured in March.&nbsp; Poor fellow, I trust he may.&nbsp; He
is not in a happy plight, I doubt.&nbsp; I wish I lived in a 
pleasant country where he might like to come and stay with 
me&mdash;but this is one of the ugliest places in <!-- page 
152--><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
152</span>England&mdash;one of the dullest&mdash;it has not the 
merit of being bleak on a grand scale&mdash;pollard trees over a 
flat clay, with regular hedges.&nbsp; I saw a stanza in an old 
book which seemed to describe my condition rather&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Far from thy kyn cast thee:<br />
Wrath not thy neighbour next thee,<br />
In a good corn country rest thee,<br />
And sit down, Robin, and rest thee. <a name="citation152"></a><a

</blockquote>
<p>Funny advice, isn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; I am glad to hear Septimus
is so much improved.&nbsp; I beg you will felicitate him from me:
I have a tacit regard of the true sort for him, as I think I must
have for all of the Tennyson build.&nbsp; I see so many little 
natures about that I must draw to the large, even if their faults
be on the same scale as their virtues.&nbsp; You and I shall I 
suppose quarrel as often as we meet: but I can quarrel and never 
be the worse with you.&nbsp; How we pulled against each other at 
Gravesend!&nbsp; You would stay&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;then
I would&mdash;then we did.&nbsp; Do you remember the face of that
girl at the Bazaar, who kept talking to us and looking all round 
the room for fresh customers&mdash;a way women have&mdash;that 
is, a way of doing rather gracefully?&nbsp; Then the gentleman 
who sang Ivy green; a very extraordinary accentuation, it seemed 
to me: but I believe you admired it very much.&nbsp; Really, if 
these little excursions in the company of one&rsquo;s friends 
leave such a pleasant taste behind in the memory, one should 
court them oftener.&nbsp; <!-- page 153--><a

then perhaps the relish would grow less: it is the infrequency 
that gives them room to expand.&nbsp; I shall never get to Italy,
that seems clear.&nbsp; My great travel this year will be to 
Carlisle.&nbsp; Quid prosit ista tua longa peregrinatio, 
etc.&nbsp; Travelling, you know, is a vanity.&nbsp; The 
<i>soul</i> remains the same.&nbsp; An amorem possis fugare, an 
libidinis exsiccari, an timorem mortis depellere?&nbsp; What then
will you say to Pollock&rsquo;s being married!&nbsp; I hear he is
to be.&nbsp; Ad matrimonium fugis?&nbsp; Miser!&nbsp; 
Sc&aelig;vola noster dicere solebat, etc.&nbsp; Excuse my

toasted cheese with that celebrated poet Bernard Barton.&nbsp; 
And I must soon stir, and look about for my great coat, brush

say, and will rain before I get to Woodbridge.&nbsp; Those poor 
mistaken lilac buds there out of the window! and an old Robin,

disheartened.&nbsp; For you must know the mild winter is just 
giving way to a remarkably severe spring. . . .&nbsp; I wish you 
were here to smoke a pipe with me.&nbsp; I play of evenings some 
of Handel&rsquo;s great choruses which are the bravest music 
after all.&nbsp; I am getting to the true John Bull style of 
music.&nbsp; I delight in Handel&rsquo;s Allegro and 
Penseroso.&nbsp; Do you know the fine pompous joyous chorus of 
&lsquo;These pleasures, Mirth, if thou canst give, 
etc.&rsquo;?&nbsp; Handel certainly does in music what old Bacon 
desires in his Essay on Masques, &lsquo;Let the songs be loud and
cheerful, not puling, etc.&rsquo;&nbsp; One <!-- page 154--><a

<p>About this time FitzGerald was engaged in collecting 
information for Carlyle on the subject of Cromwell&rsquo;s 
Lincolnshire campaign, and it is to this he refers in the 
following fragment of a letter to Mrs. Charlesworth and the 
letters which follow.</p>
<blockquote><p>But as Carlyle is like to make good use of what we
can find him, and make a good English Hero of 
Oliver&mdash;something of a Johnsonian figure&mdash;I hope you 
will try and pester these Lincoln ladies and gentlemen.&nbsp; I 
wrote to Livesey: who once, he says, had a butler named Oliver 
Cromwell.&nbsp; That is the nearest approach to history I make 
through him.</p>
<p>My brother John, after being expected every day this week, 
wrote positively to say he could not come to day: and accordingly
was seen to drive up to the Hall two hours ago. *</p>
<p>Believe me, dear Mrs. Charlesworth, yours thankfully,</p>

a daring attack of Cromwell&rsquo;s: but my memory is bad.&nbsp; 
Your correspondent says that bones, spurs, and <i>urns</i> have 
been found there: the latter look rather as if the hill were of

<i>exactly where</i> the relics were dug up: whether on the hill

Mrs. Allenby&rsquo;s first letter says <i>that</i> was probably 
the field of battle: her son says the hill itself was.&nbsp; 
Also, <i>exactly what the relics were</i>.&nbsp; These two points
are the chief I can see to need thorough sifting.&nbsp; I sent

<p>I last night smoked a pipe with Carlyle.&nbsp; He has had two 
large packets from Dr. Cookson, who shows alacrity enough to do 
what is asked, and may turn up something.&nbsp; But he has 
chiefly spoken of Winsby: and your Allenbys had so well cleared 
all that matter up with their map, etc., that the Doctor was 
going over needless ground.&nbsp; I hope we may be as successful 
with some other field: or rather that Cookson will anticipate us

<p>London is very hateful to me.&nbsp; I long to spread wing and

the streets half so handsome as Mr. Reynolds <a

says his wife likes London.&nbsp; I get radishes to eat for

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Barton</span>,</p>
<p>I am still indignant at this nasty place London.&nbsp; 
Thackeray, whom I came up to see, went off to Brighton the night 
after I arrived, and has not re-appeared: but I must wait some 
time longer for him.&nbsp; Thank Miss Barton much for the 
<i>kit</i>; if it is but a kit: my old woman is a great lover of 
cats, and hers has just <i>kitted</i>, and a wretched little 
blind puling tabby lizard of a thing was to be saved from the 
pail for me: but if Miss Barton&rsquo;s is a <i>kit</i>, I will 
gladly have it: and my old lady&rsquo;s shall be disposed 
of&mdash;not to the pail.&nbsp; Oh rus, quando te aspiciam?&nbsp;
Construe that, Mr. Barton.&mdash;I am going to send down my 
pictures to Boulge, if I can secure them: they are not quite 
secure at present.&nbsp; If they vanish, I snap my fingers at 
them, Magi and all&mdash;there is a world (alas!) elsewhere 
beyond pictures&mdash;Oh, oh, oh, oh&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>I smoked a pipe with Carlyle yesterday.&nbsp; We 
ascended from his dining room carrying pipes and tobacco up 
through two stories of his house, and got into a little dressing 
room near the roof: there we sat down: the window was open and 
looked out on nursery gardens, their almond trees in blossom, and
beyond, bare walls of houses, and over these, roofs and chimneys,
and roofs and chimneys, and here and there a steeple, and whole 
London crowned with darkness gathering behind like the 
illimitable resources of a dream.&nbsp; I tried to persuade him 
to leave the accursed den, and he 
wished&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;perhaps he <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> 
wish on the whole.</p>
<p>When I get back to Boulge I shall recover my quietude which is
now all in a ripple.&nbsp; But it is a shame to talk of such 
things.&nbsp; So Churchyard has caught another Constable.&nbsp; 
Did he get off our Debach boy that set the shed on fire?&nbsp; 
Ask him that.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;st thou not minister to a mind 
diseased, etc.</p>
<p>A cloud comes over Charlotte Street and seems as if it were 
sailing softly on the April wind to fall in a blessed shower upon
the lilac buds and thirsty anemones somewhere in Essex; or, who 
knows?, perhaps at Boulge.&nbsp; Out will run Mrs. Faiers, and 
with red arms and face of woe haul in the struggling windows of 
the cottage, and make all tight.&nbsp; Beauty Bob <a 
name="citation159"></a><a href="#footnote159" 
class="citation">[159]</a> will cast a bird&rsquo;s eye out at 
the shower, and bless the useful wet.&nbsp; Mr. Loder will 
observe to the farmer for whom he is doing up a dozen of 
Queen&rsquo;s <!-- page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>Heads, that it will be of great use:
and the farmer will agree that his young barleys wanted it 
much.&nbsp; The German Ocean will dimple with innumerable pin 
points, and porpoises rolling near the surface sneeze with 
unusual pellets of fresh water&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can such things be,<br />
And overcome us like a summer cloud,<br />
Without our special wonder?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh this wonderful wonderful world, and we who stand in the 
middle of it are all in a maze, except poor Matthews of Bedford, 
who fixes his eyes upon a wooden Cross and has no misgiving 
whatsoever.&nbsp; When I was at his chapel on Good Friday, he 
called at the end of his grand sermon on some of the people to 
say merely this, that they believed Christ had redeemed them: and
first one got up and in sobs declared she believed it: and then 
another, and then another&mdash;I was quite overset:&mdash;all 
poor people: how much richer than all who fill the London 
Churches.&nbsp; Theirs is the kingdom of Heaven!</p>
<p>This is a sad farrago.&nbsp; Farewell.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>To Mrs. Charlesworth</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[27 <i>April</i>, 1844?]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Charlesworth</span>,</p>
<p>Thank you over and over again for your letter.&nbsp; The last 
packet with sketches, etc., came all safe yesterday: and Carlyle 
is much pleased.&nbsp; We may say that Winsby Field is exhausted 
now.&nbsp; I should <!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>like however to have some sketch of 
the <i>relics</i>: the shape of the stone jugs: their size 
specified.&nbsp; The <i>helmet</i> could be identified with the 
military fashion of some reign, as represented in prints, 
pictures, etc.&nbsp; But on the whole, the Allenbys have done 
capitally: and so have you: and so have I: and so I hope will 
Carlyle one day.&nbsp; He begs seriously to thank you and the 
Allenbys.</p>
<p>He was much distressed at Dr. Cookson&rsquo;s death: <a 
name="citation161"></a><a href="#footnote161" 
class="citation">[161]</a> and said how he should feel it when he
came to think of it alone.&nbsp; Such is the man: he will call 
all the wits in London dilettanti, etc., but let a poor fellow 
die, and the Scotch heart flows forth in tears.</p>
<p>If any one can be found to do half as much for Gainsborough 
(which was an important battle) as has been done for Winsby, why,
the Lincolnshire campaign will be handsomely reported.&nbsp; At 
Grantham there is no such great interest, it appears.</p>
<p>I hope to get out of London to my poor old Boulge next 
week.&nbsp; I have seen all my friends so as to satisfy them that
I am a duller country fellow than I was, and so we shall part 
without heart-breaking on either side.&nbsp; It is partly 
one&rsquo;s fault not to be up to the London mark: but as there 
is a million of persons in the land fully up to it, one has the 
less call to repent in that respect.&nbsp; I confess that Mr. 
Reynolds is a better sight to me than old rouged Lady Morgan and 
all such.</p>

points, we shall help to lay that unquiet spirit of history which

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Frederic</span>,</p>
<p>I think you mean never to write to me again.&nbsp; But you 
should, for I enjoy your letters much for years after I have got 
them.&nbsp; They tell me all I shall know of Italy, beside many 
other good things.&nbsp; I received one letter from you from 
Florence, and as you gave me no particular direction, I wrote to 
you at the Poste Restante there.&nbsp; I am now inditing this 
letter on the same venture.&nbsp; As my location is much more 
permanent, I command you to respond to me the very day you get 
this, warmed into such faint inspiration as my turnip radiance 
can kindle.&nbsp; You have seen a turnip lantern perhaps.&nbsp; 
Well, here I continue to exist: having broken my rural vegetation
by one month in London, where I saw all the old faces&mdash;some 
only in passing, however&mdash;saw as few sights as possible, 
leaving London two days before the Exhibition opened.&nbsp; This 
is not out of moroseness or love of singularity: but I really 
supposed there could be nothing new: and therefore the best way 
would [be] to come new to it oneself after three or four years 
absence.&nbsp; I see in Punch a humorous catalogue of supposed 
pictures; Prince Albert&rsquo;s favourite spaniel and bootjack, 
the Queen&rsquo;s Macaw with a Muffin, etc., by Landseer, etc., 
in which I recognize Thackeray&rsquo;s <!-- page 164--><a 
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
164</span>fancy.&nbsp; He is in full vigour play and pay in 
London, writing in a dozen reviews, and a score of newspapers: 
and while health lasts he sails before the wind.&nbsp; I have not
heard of Alfred since March. . . .&nbsp; Spedding devotes his 
days to Lord Bacon in the British Museum: his nights to the usual
profligacy. . . .&nbsp; My dear Frederic, you must select some of
your poems and publish them: we want some bits of strong genuine 
imagination to help put to flight these&mdash;etc.&nbsp; Publish 
a book of fragments, if nothing else but single lines, or else 
the whole poems.&nbsp; When will you come to England and do 
it?&nbsp; I dare say I should have stayed longer in London had 
you been there: but the wits were too much for me.&nbsp; Not 
Spedding, mind: who is a dear fellow.&nbsp; But one finds few in 
London <i>serious</i> men: I mean <i>serious</i> even in fun: 
with a true purpose and character whatsoever it may be.&nbsp; 
London melts away all individuality into a common lump of 
cleverness.&nbsp; I am amazed at the humour and worth and noble 
feeling in the country, however much railroads have mixed us up 
with metropolitan civilization.&nbsp; I can still find the heart 
of England beating healthily down here, though no one will 
believe it.</p>
<p>You know my way of life so well that I need not describe it to
you, as it has undergone no change since I saw you.&nbsp; I read 
of mornings; the same old books over and over again, having no 
command of new ones: walk with my great black <!-- page 165--><a 
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>dog of an 
afternoon, and at evening sit with open windows, up to which 
China roses climb, with my pipe, while the blackbirds and 
thrushes begin to rustle bedwards in the garden, and the 
nightingale to have the neighbourhood to herself.&nbsp; We have 
had such a spring (bating the last ten days) as would have 
satisfied even you with warmth.&nbsp; And such verdure! white 
clouds moving over the new fledged tops of oak trees, and acres 
of grass striving with buttercups.&nbsp; How old to tell of, how 
new to see!&nbsp; I believe that Leslie&rsquo;s Life of Constable
(a very charming book) has given me a fresh love of Spring.&nbsp;
Constable loved it above all seasons: he hated Autumn.&nbsp; When
Sir G. Beaumont who was of the old classical taste asked him if 
he did not find it difficult to place <i>his brown tree</i> in 
his pictures, &lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; said C., &lsquo;I never 
put one in at all.&rsquo;&nbsp; And when Sir George was crying up
the tone of the old masters&rsquo; landscapes, and quoting an old
violin as the proper tone of colour for a picture, Constable got 
up, took an old Cremona, and laid it down on the sunshiny 
grass.&nbsp; You would like the book.&nbsp; In defiance of all 
this, I have hung my room with pictures, like very old fiddles 
indeed: but I agree with Sir George and Constable both.&nbsp; I 
like pictures that are not like nature.&nbsp; I can have nature 
better than any picture by looking out of my window.&nbsp; Yet I 
respect the man who tries to paint up to the freshness of earth 
and sky.&nbsp; Constable did not wholly achieve what he tried 
<!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
166</span>at: and perhaps the old masters chose a soberer scale 
of things as more within the compass of lead paint.&nbsp; To 
paint dew with lead!</p>
<p>I also plunge away at my old Handel of nights, and delight in 
the Allegro and Penseroso, full of pomp and fancy.&nbsp; What a 
pity Handel could not have written music to some great Masque, 
such as Ben Jonson or Milton would have written, if they had 
known of such a musician to write for.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Laurence</span>,</p>
<p>I hope your business is settled by this time.&nbsp; I have 
seen praise of your picture in the Athen&aelig;um, which quoted 
also the Chronicle&rsquo;s good opinion.&nbsp; I am very glad of 
all this and I hope you will now set to work, and paint away with
ease and confidence, forgetting that there is such a hue as 
bottle-green <a name="citation166"></a><a href="#footnote166" 
class="citation">[166]</a> in the universe (it was tastefully 
omitted from the rainbow, you see); and, in spite of what Moore 
says, paint English people in English atmospheres.&nbsp; Your 
Coningham was rather orange, wasn&rsquo;t he?&nbsp; But he was 
very good, I thought.&nbsp; Dress your ladies in cheerful 
dresses, not quite so vulgar as Chalon&rsquo;s. . . . I <!-- page
167--><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
167</span>heard from my sister that you had finished Wilkinson to
the perfect content of all: I had charged her particularly not to
allow Mrs. W. to intercede for any smirk or alteration 
whatever.</p>
<p>My Venetian pictures look very grand on my walls, which 
previously had been papered with a still green (not bottled) on 
purpose to receive them.&nbsp; On my table is a long necked 
bottle with three flowers just now in it . . . a tuft of 
rhododendron, a tuft of scarlet geranium, and a tuft of white 
gilli-flower.&nbsp; Do you see these in your mind&rsquo;s 
eye?&nbsp; I wish you could come down here and refresh your 
sodden eyes with pure daylight, budding oak trees, and all the 
changes of sky and cloud.&nbsp; To live to make sonnets about 
these things, and doat upon them, is worse Cockneyism than 
rejoicing in the sound of Bow Bells for ever so long: but here 
one has them whether one will or no: and they are better than 
Lady Morgan and --- at a rout in Harley Street.&nbsp; Maclise is 
a handsome and fine fellow, I think: and Landseer is very good 
natured.&nbsp; I long for my old Alfred portrait here sometimes: 
but you had better keep it for the present.&nbsp; W. Browne and 
Spedding are with me, good representatives one of the Vita 
Contemplativa, the other of the Vita Attiva.&nbsp; Spedding, if 
you tell him this, will not allow that he has not the elements of
Action in him: nor has he not: nor has not the other those of 
contemplation: but each inclines a different way 
notwithstanding.&nbsp; I wish you and <!-- page 168--><a

could come down here: though there is little to see, and to 
eat.&nbsp; When you write you must put <i>Woodbridge</i> after 
Boulge.&nbsp; This letter of yours went to Bury St. Edmunds, for

<p>I got here but yesterday, from Bedford, where I left W. Browne
in train to be married to a rich woman.&nbsp; When I heard that 
they could not have less than five hundred a year, I gave up all 
further interest in the matter: for I could not wish a reasonable
couple more.&nbsp; W. B. may be spoilt if he grows rich: that is 
the only thing could spoil him.&nbsp; This time ten years I first
went to ride and fish with him about the river Ouse&mdash;he was 
then 18&mdash;quick to love and quick to fight&mdash;full of 
confidence, generosity, and the glorious spirit of Youth. . . 
.&nbsp; I shall go to Church and hope he mayn&rsquo;t be defiled

<p><!-- page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

soul.&nbsp; He described the crucifixion in a way that put the 
scene before his people&mdash;no fine words, and metaphors: but 
first one nail struck into one hand, and then into another, and 
one through both feet&mdash;the cross lifted up with God in 
man&rsquo;s image distended upon it.&nbsp; And the sneers of the

at him&mdash;he talked of saving others, etc.&rsquo;&nbsp; And 
then the sun veiled his face in Blood, etc.&nbsp; I certainly 
have heard oratory now&mdash;of the Lord Chatham kind, only 
Matthews has more faith in Christ than Pitt in his 
majority.&nbsp; I was almost as much taken aback as the poor

<p style="text-align: center"><i>To S. Laurence</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Boulge</span>, 
<i>July</i> 4/44.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Laurence</span>,</p>
<p>I have but lately returned from Holbrook, where I saw your 
last portrait of Wilkinson.&nbsp; It is very capital, and gives 
my sister and all her neighbours great satisfaction.&nbsp; Jane 
indeed can talk of nothing else.&nbsp; I will say this however, 
with my usual ignorance and presumption, that I think the last 
day&rsquo;s sitting made it a little heavier than when I left it 
unfinished.&nbsp; Was it that the final glazing was somewhat too 
thick?&nbsp; I only mention this as a very slight defect, which I
should not have observed had I not seen its penultimate state, 
and were I not a crotchetty stickler for lightness and 
ease.&nbsp; But I hope and trust you will now do all your future 
sketches in oil in the same way in which this is done: the long 
brush, the wholesome distance between canvas, painter, and 
sitter, and the few sittings.&nbsp; For myself, I have always 
been sure of this: but I can assert it to you with more 
confidence now, seeing that every one else seems to <!-- page 
171--><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
171</span>agree with me, if I may judge by the general approval 
of this specimen of the long brush.&nbsp; Besides, such a method 
must shorten your labour, preserve the freshness of your eye and 
spirit, and also ensure the similitude of the sitter to himself 
by the very speediness of the operation.</p>
<p>Mills was very much delighted at W.&rsquo;s portrait.&nbsp; 
What will you say of me when I tell you that I did not encourage 
him to have his wife painted by you, as he seemed to 
purpose!&nbsp; You will pray heaven to deliver you from your 
friends.&nbsp; But notwithstanding this, I am sure this last 
portrait will bring you sitters from this part of the 
country.&nbsp; Perhaps you will not find it easy to forgive me 
this.&nbsp; I must tell you that Mrs. Mills, who sets up to be no
judge of pictures, but who never is wrong about anything, 
instantly pitched on your portrait of Coningham as the best in 
the Exhibition, without seeing who it was by: and when she 
referred to the Catalogue, called out to her husband &lsquo;Why 
this is by E. F. G.&rsquo;s friend Mr. Laurence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>July 18.&nbsp; You see that all up to this was written a 
fortnight ago.&nbsp; I did not finish, for I did not know where 
to direct.&nbsp; And now I shall finish this portrait of my mind,
you see, in a different aspect perhaps to that with which I set 
out.&nbsp; On looking over what I wrote however, I stick to all I
said about the painting: as to Mrs. Mills, whose case seems to 
require some extenuation on my part, I fancied she was one of 
those persons&rsquo; faces you would not take to: and so <!-- 
page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
172</span>not succeed in.&nbsp; It is rather a pretty face, 
without meaning, it seems to me: and yet she has meaning in 
her.&nbsp; Mills has already had one portrait of her, which 
discontents all, and therefore it was I would not advise any 
painter who did not understand the art of <i>Millinery</i> well: 
for if the face does not wholly content, there is the dress to 
fall back on.&nbsp; I fancy Chalon would do the business.</p>
<p>I hear you have been doing some brother or brother in law of 
Mrs. Lumsden.&nbsp; Mind what I have told you.&nbsp; I may not be
a good judge of painting, but I can judge of what people in 
general like. . . .</p>

London on your summer excursion, whithersoever that is to

<p>I have nothing to tell you of myself.&nbsp; Here I exist, and 
read scraps of books, garden a little, and am on good terms with 
my neighbours.&nbsp; The Times paper is stirring up our farming 
society to the root, and some good will come of it, I dare say, 
and some ill.&nbsp; Do you know of any good books on Education? 
not for the poor or Charity schools, but on modern

Snuff.&nbsp; I beg leave to say that this letter is written with 
a pen of my own making: the first I have made these twenty 
years.&nbsp; I doubt after all it is no proof of a very 
intelligent pen-Creator, but only of a lucky slit.&nbsp; The next
effort shall decide.&nbsp; Farewell, my dear Fellow.&nbsp;

<p>You will think I have forgot you.&nbsp; I spent four pleasant 
days with Donne: who looks pale and thin, and in whose face the 
grey is creeping up from those once flourishing whiskers to the 
skull.&nbsp; It is doing so with me.&nbsp; We are neither of us 
in what may be called the first dawn of boyhood.&nbsp; Donne 
maintains his shape better than I do, but sorrow I doubt has done
that: and so we see why the house of mourning is better than the 
stalled ox.&nbsp; For it is a grievous thing to grow poddy: the 
age of Chivalry is gone then.&nbsp; An old proverb says that 
&lsquo;a full belly neither fights nor flies well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I also saw Geldart at Norwich.&nbsp; He paints, and is deep in
religious thoughts also: he has besides the finest English good 
sense about him: and altogether <!-- page 174--><a 
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>he is a man
one goes to that one may learn from him.&nbsp; I walked much 
about Norwich and was pleased with the old place.</p>
<p>Here I see my old friend Mrs. Schutz, and play with the 
children.&nbsp; Having shown the little girl the prints of 
Boz&rsquo;s Curiosity Shop, I have made a short abstract of 
Little Nelly&rsquo;s wanderings which interests her much, leaving
out the Swivellers, etc.&nbsp; For children do not understand how
merriment should intrude in a serious matter.&nbsp; This might 
make a nice child&rsquo;s book, cutting out Boz&rsquo;s sham 
pathos, as well as the real fun; and it forms a kind of Nelly-ad,
<a name="citation174a"></a><a href="#footnote174a"

delighted with D&rsquo;Israeli&rsquo;s Coningsby, which I advised
him to read.&nbsp; Have you read it?&nbsp; The children still 
wonder what Miss Charlesworth meant when she said that she 
didn&rsquo;t mean what she said.&nbsp; I tell them it is a new 
way of thinking of young England.&nbsp; I have exercised the

reticence (that is not the word) but I find that children, who

<p>. . . I expect to be here about a week, and I mean to give a 
day to looking over the field of Edgehill, on the top of which, I
have ascertained, there is a very delightful pot-house, 
commanding a very extensive view.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you wish to 
sit at ease in such a high tower, with a pint of porter at your 
side, and to see beneath you the ground that was galloped over by
Rupert and Cromwell two hundred years ago, in one of the richest 
districts of England, and on one of the finest days in October, 
for such my day is to be?</p>
<p>In the meanwhile I cast regretful glances of memory back to my
garden at Boulge, which I want to see dug up and replanted.&nbsp;
I have bought anemone roots which in the Spring shall blow Tyrian
dyes, and Irises of a newer and more brilliant prism than Noah 
saw in the clouds.&nbsp; I have bought a picture of my poor 
quarrelsome friend Moore, just to help him; for I don&rsquo;t 
know what to do with his picture.</p>

<p>You will think I have wholly cut you.&nbsp; But I wrote half a
letter to you three months ago; and mislaid it; spent some time 
in looking for it, always hoping; and then some more time 
despairing; and we all know how time goes when [we] have got a 
thing to do which we are rather lazy about doing.&nbsp; As for 
instance, getting up in a morning.&nbsp; Not that writing a 
letter to you is so bad as getting up; but it is not easy for 
mortal man who has heard, seen, done, and thought, nothing since 
he last wrote, to fill one of these big foreign sheets full as a 
foreign letter ought to be.&nbsp; I am now returned to my dull 
home here after my usual pottering about in the midland counties 
of England.&nbsp; A little Bedfordshire&mdash;a little 
Northamptonshire&mdash;a little more folding of the 
hands&mdash;the same faces&mdash;the same fields&mdash;the same 
thoughts occurring at the same turns of road&mdash;this is all I 
have to tell of; nothing at all added&mdash;but the summer 
gone.&nbsp; My garden is covered with yellow and brown leaves; 
and a man is digging up the garden beds before my window, and 
will plant some roots and bulbs for next year.&nbsp; My parsons 
come and smoke with me, etc.&nbsp; &lsquo;The round of life from 
hour to hour&rsquo;&mdash;alluding doubtless to a 
mill-horse.&nbsp; Alfred is reported to be still at Park House, 
where he has been sojourning <!-- page 177--><a 
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>for two 
months, I think; but he never writes me a word.&nbsp; Hydropathy 
has done its worst; he writes the names of his friends in water. 
. . .&nbsp; I spent two days in London with old Morton about five
weeks ago; and pleasant days they were.&nbsp; The rogue bewitches
me with his wit and honest speech.&nbsp; He also staid some while
at Park House, while Alfred was there, and managed of course to 
frighten the party occasionally with some of his sallies.&nbsp; 
He often writes to me; and very good his letters are all of 
them.</p>
<p>When do you mean to write me another?&nbsp; Morton told me in 
his last that he had heard from Brotherton you were gone, or 
going, to Naples.&nbsp; I dare say this sheet of mine will never 
get to your hands.&nbsp; But if it does, let me hear from 
you.&nbsp; Is Italy becoming stale to you?&nbsp; Are you going to
Cairo for fresh sensations?&nbsp; Thackeray went off in a 
steamboat about the time the French were before Mogadore; he was 
to see those coasts and to visit Jerusalem!&nbsp; Titmarsh at 
Jerusalem will certainly be an era in Christianity.&nbsp; But I 
suppose he will soon be back now.&nbsp; Spedding is yet in his 
highlands, I believe, considering Grouse and Bacon.</p>
<p>I expect to run up to London some time during the winter just 
to tell over old friends&rsquo; faces and get a sup of music and 
painting.&nbsp; I have bought very few more pictures lately; and 
[heard] no music but Mendelssohn&rsquo;s M. Night&rsquo;s 
Dream.&nbsp; The overture, which was published long ago, is the 
best part; but there is a very noble triumphal march also.</p>
<p><!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>Now I feel just in the same fix as I did in that sheet 
of paper whose fate is uncertain.&nbsp; But if I don&rsquo;t put 
in a word more, yet this shall go, I am determined.&nbsp; Only 
consider how it is a matter of necessity that I should have 
nothing to say.&nbsp; If you could see this place of 
Boulge!&nbsp; You who sit and survey marble palaces rising out of
cypress and olive.&nbsp; There is a dreadful vulgar ballad, 
composed by Mr. Balfe, and sung with the most unbounded applause 
by Miss Rainforth,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I dreamt that I dwelt in marble 
Halls,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which is sung and organed at every corner in London.&nbsp; I 
think you may imagine what kind of flowing 6/8 time of the last 
degree of imbecility it is.&nbsp; The words are written by Mr. 
Bunn!&nbsp; Arcades ambo.</p>
<p>I say we shall see you over in England before long: for I 
rather think you want an Englishman to quarrel with 
sometimes.&nbsp; I mean quarrel in the sense of a good strenuous 
difference of opinion, supported on either side by occasional 
outbursts of spleen.&nbsp; Come and let us try.&nbsp; You used to
irritate my vegetable blood sometimes.</p>

<p>My return to Boulge is delayed for another week, because we 
expect my Father here just now.&nbsp; But for this, I should have
been on the Union Coach this <!-- page 179--><a 
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>day.&nbsp; 
The children here are most delightful; the best company in all 
the world, to my mind.&nbsp; If you could see the little girl 
dance the Polka with her sisters!&nbsp; Not set up like an Infant
Terpsichore, but seriously inclined, with perfect steps in 
perfect time.</p>
<p>We see a fine white frost over the grass this morning; and I 
suppose you have rubbed your hands and cried &lsquo;Oh Lauk, how 
cold it is!&rsquo; twenty times before I write this.&nbsp; Now 
one&rsquo;s pictures become doubly delightful to one.&nbsp; I 
certainly love winter better than summer.&nbsp; Could one but 
know, as one sits within the tropic latitude of one&rsquo;s 
fireside, that there was not increased want, cold, and misery, 
beyond it!</p>
<p>My Spectator tells me that Leigh Hunt has published a good 
volume of Poem-selections; not his own poems, but of 
others.&nbsp; And Miss Martineau has been cured of an illness of 
five years standing by Mesmerism!&nbsp; By the help of a few 
passes of the hand following an earnest Will, she, who had not 
set foot out of her room, for the chief part of those five years,
now can tread the grass again, and walk five miles!&nbsp; Her 
account of the business in the Athen&aelig;um is extremely 
interesting.&nbsp; She is the only one I have read of who 
describes the sensations of <i>the trance</i>, which, seeming a 
painful one to the wide-awake looker on, is in fact a state of 
tranquil glorification to the patient.&nbsp; It cheers but not 
inebriates!&nbsp; She felt her disease oozing away out at her 
feet, and as it were streams of warm fresh vitality coming in its
place.&nbsp; And when she woke, lo, this was no dream!</p>

<p>What is a poor devil to do?&nbsp; You tell me quite truly that
my letters have not two ideas in them, and yet you tell me to 
write my two ideas as soon as I can.&nbsp; So indeed it is so far
easy to write down one&rsquo;s two ideas, if they are not very 
abstruse ones; but then what the devil encouragement is it to a 
poor fellow to expose his nakedness so?&nbsp; All I can say is, 
to say again that if you lived in this place, you would not write
so long a letter as you have done, full of capital description 
and all good things; though without any compliment I am sure you 
would write a better than I shall.&nbsp; But you see the original
fault in me is that I choose to be in such a place as this at 
all; that argues certainly a talent for dullness which no 
situation nor intercourse of men could much improve.&nbsp; It is 
true; I really do like to sit in this doleful place with a good 
fire, a cat and dog on the rug, and an old woman in the 
kitchen.&nbsp; This is all my live stock.&nbsp; The house is yet 
damp as last year; and the great event of this winter is my 
putting up a trough round the eaves to carry off the wet.&nbsp; 
There was discussion whether the trough should be of iron or of 
zinc: iron dear and lasting; zinc the reverse.&nbsp; It was 
decided for iron; and accordingly iron is put up.</p>
<p>Why should I not live in London and see the world? you 
say.&nbsp; Why then <i>I</i> say as before, I don&rsquo;t <!-- 
page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
181</span>like it.&nbsp; I think the dullness of country people 
is better than the impudence of Londoners; and the fresh cold and
wet of our clay fields better than a fog that stinks <i>per 
se</i>; and this room of mine, clean at all events, better than a
dirty room in Charlotte St.&nbsp; If you, Morton, and Alfred, 
were more in London, I should be there more; but now there is but
Spedding and Allen whom I care a straw about.&nbsp; I have 
written two notes to Alfred to ask him just to notify his 
existence to me; but you know he is obstinate on that 
point.&nbsp; I heard from Carlyle that he (Alfred) had passed an 
evening at Chelsea much to C.&rsquo;s delight; who has opened the
gates of his Valhalla to let Alfred in. <a 
name="citation181"></a><a href="#footnote181" 
class="citation">[181]</a>&nbsp; Thackeray is at Malta, where I 
am told he means to winter. . . .</p>
<p>As I have no people to tell you of, so have I very few books, 
and know nothing of what is stirring in the literary world.&nbsp;
I have read the Life of Arnold of <!-- page 182--><a 
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>Rugby, who 
was a noble fellow; and the letters of Burke, which do not add 
to, or detract from, what I knew and liked in him before.&nbsp; I
am meditating to begin Thucydides one day; perhaps this winter. .
. .&nbsp; Old Seneca, I have no doubt, was a great humbug in 
deed, and his books have plenty of it in word; but he had got 
together a vast deal of what was not humbug from others; and, as 
far as I see, the old philosophers are available now as much as 
two thousand years back.&nbsp; Perhaps you will think that is not
saying much.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t suppose I think it good philosophy
in myself to keep here out of the world, and sport a gentle 
Epicurism; I do not; I only follow something of a natural 
inclination, and know not if I could do better under a more 
complex system.&nbsp; It is very smooth sailing hitherto down 
here.&nbsp; No velvet waistcoat and ever-lustrous pumps to be 
considered; no bon mots got up; no information necessary.&nbsp; 
There is a pipe for the parsons to smoke, and quite as much bon 
mots, literature, and philosophy as they care for without any 
trouble at all.&nbsp; If we could but feed our poor!&nbsp; It is 
now the 8th of December; it has blown a most desperate East wind,
all razors; a wind like one of those knives one sees at shops in 
London, with 365 blades all drawn and pointed; the wheat is all 
sown; the fallows cannot be ploughed.&nbsp; What are all the poor
folks to do during the winter?&nbsp; And they persist in having 
the same enormous families they used to do; a woman came to me 
two days ago who had seventeen children!&nbsp; <!-- page 183--><a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>What 
farmers are to employ all these?&nbsp; What Landlord can find 
room for them?&nbsp; The law of Generation must be 
repealed.&nbsp; The London press does nothing but rail at us poor
country folks for our cruelty.&nbsp; I am glad they do so; for 
there is much to be set right.&nbsp; But I want to know if the 
Editor of the Times is more attentive to his devils, their wives 
and families, than our squires and squiresses and parsons are to 
their fellow parishioners.&nbsp; Punch also assumes a tone of 
virtuous satire, from the mouth of Mr. Douglas Jerrold!&nbsp; It 
is easy to sit in arm chairs at a club in Pall Mall and rail on 
the stupidity and brutality of those in High Suffolk.</p>
<p>Come, I have got more than two ideas into this sheet; but I 
don&rsquo;t know if you won&rsquo;t dislike them worse than mere 
nothing.&nbsp; But I was determined to fill my letter.&nbsp; Yes,
you are to know that I slept at Woodbridge last night, went to 
church there this morning, where every one sat with a purple 
nose, and heard a dismal well-meant sermon; and the organ blew us
out with one grand idea at all events, one of old Handel&rsquo;s 
Coronation Anthems; that I dined early, also in Woodbridge; and 
walked up here with a tremendous East wind blowing sleet in my 
face from over the German Sea, that I found your letter when I 
entered my room; and reading it through, determined to spin you 
off a sheet incontinently, and lo! here it is!&nbsp; Now or 
never!&nbsp; I shall now have my tea in, and read over your 
letter again while at it.&nbsp; You are quite right in saying 
that Gravesend <!-- page 184--><a name="page184"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>excursions with you do me 
good.&nbsp; When did I doubt it?&nbsp; I remember them with great
pleasure; few of my travels so much so.&nbsp; I like a short 
journey in good company; and I like you all the better for your 
Englishman&rsquo;s humours.&nbsp; One doesn&rsquo;t find such 
things in London; something more like it here in the country, 
where every one, with whatever natural stock of intellect 
endowed, at least grows up his own way, and flings his branches 
about him, not stretched on the espalier of London dinner-table 
company.</p>
<p>P.S.&nbsp; Next morning.&nbsp; Snow over the ground.&nbsp; We 
have our wonders of inundation in Suffolk also, I can tell 
you.&nbsp; For three weeks ago such floods came, that an old 
woman was carried off as she was retiring from a beer house about
9 p.m., and drowned.&nbsp; She was probably half seas over before
she left the beer house.</p>
<p>And three nights ago I looked out at about ten o&rsquo;clock 
at night, before going to bed.&nbsp; It seemed perfectly still; 
frosty, and the stars shining bright.&nbsp; I heard a continuous 
moaning sound, which I knew to be, not that of an infant exposed,
or female ravished, but of the sea, more than ten miles 
off!&nbsp; What little wind there was carried to us the murmurs 
of the waves circulating round these coasts so far over a flat 
country.&nbsp; But people here think that this sound so heard is 
not from the waves that break, but a kind of prophetic voice from
the body of the sea itself announcing great gales.&nbsp; Sure 
enough we have got <!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>them, however heralded.&nbsp; Now I 
say that all this shows that we in this Suffolk are not so 
completely given over to prose and turnips as some would have 
us.&nbsp; I always said that being near the sea, and being able 
to catch a glimpse of it from the tops of hills, and of houses, 
redeemed Suffolk from dullness; and at all events that our turnip
fields, dull in themselves, were at least set all round with an 
undeniably poetic element.&nbsp; And so I see Arnold says; he 
enumerates five inland counties as the only parts of England for 
which nothing could be said in praise.&nbsp; Not that I agree 
with him there neither; I cannot allow the valley of the Ouse 
about which some of my pleasantest recollections hang to be 
without its great charm.&nbsp; W. Browne, whom you despised, is 
married, and I shall see but little of him for the future.&nbsp; 
I have laid by my rod and line by the willows of the Ouse for 
ever.&nbsp; &lsquo;He is married and cannot come.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
This change is the true meaning of those verses, <a 
name="citation185"></a><a href="#footnote185" 
class="citation">[185]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Friend after friend departs;<br />
Who has not lost a friend?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and so on.&nbsp; If I were conscious of being stedfast and 
good humoured enough, I would marry to-morrow.&nbsp; But a 
humourist is best by himself.</p>

something to reflect upon in your silent meeting.&nbsp;

Vestiges.&nbsp; I found people talking about it here; and one 
laudatory critique in the Examiner sold an edition in a few 
days.&nbsp; I long to finish it.&nbsp; I am going in state to the
London Library&mdash;<i>my</i> Library&mdash;to review the store 
of books it contains, and carry down a box full for winter 
consumption.&nbsp; Do you want anything? eh, Mr. Barton?</p>
<p>I went to see Sophocles&rsquo; tragedy of Antigone done into 
English two nights ago.&nbsp; And yesterday I dined with my dear 
old John Allen who remains whole and intact of the world in the 
heart of London.&nbsp; He <!-- page 187--><a 
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>dined some 
while ago at Lambeth, and the Lady next him asked the Archbishop 
if he read Punch.&nbsp; Allen thought this was a misplaced 
question: but I think the Archbishop ought to see Punch: though 
not to read it regularly perhaps.&nbsp; I then asked Allen about 
the Vestiges&mdash;he had heard of it&mdash;laughed at the idea 
of its being atheistical.&nbsp; &lsquo;No enquiry,&rsquo; said 
he, &lsquo;can be atheistical.&rsquo;&nbsp; I doubt if the 
Archbishop of Canterbury could say that.&nbsp; What do you think 
of Exeter?&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t he a pretty lad?</p>

wants other notes than elegiac now?&nbsp; Lycidas is the utmost 
length an elegiac should reach.&nbsp; But Spedding praises: and I
suppose the elegiacs will see daylight, public daylight, one 
day.&nbsp; Carlyle goes on growling with his Cromwell: whom he 
finds more and more faultless every day.&nbsp; So that <i>his</i>

different kind from Tennyson&rsquo;s; as far apart indeed as 
Cromwell and Hallam.</p>

<p>. . . You like to hear of men and manners.&nbsp; Have I not 
been to London for a whole fortnight, seen Alfred, Spedding, all 
the lawyers and all the painters, gone to Panoramas of Naples by 
Volcano-light (Vesuvius in a blaze illuminating the whole bay, 
which Morton says is not a bit better than Plymouth Sound, if you
could put a furnace in the belly of Mount Edgecumbe)&mdash;gone 
to see the Antigone of Messrs. Sophocles and Mendelssohn at

little of an Infant as a Thalia&mdash;at the Adelaide

us.&nbsp; Only the Thalia has waxed in stature: and perhaps in

is, as you are aware, a neatly constructed drama, on the French

turn up your nose at it, I dare say.&nbsp; It was horribly ill 
sung, by a chorus in shabby togas, who looked much more like 
dirty bakers than Theban (were they?) respectable old

Antigone.&nbsp; I forget the name of the lady who did Ismene; <a

day of Spring.&nbsp; The woodpigeons coo in the covert; the frogs
croak in the pond; the bees hum about some thyme, and some of my

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Barton</span>,</p>
<p>You see my address.&nbsp; I only got into it yesterday, though
I reached London on Friday, and hung loose upon it for all that 
interval.&nbsp; I spent four days at Cambridge pleasantly enough;
and one at Bedford where I heard my friend Matthews preach.</p>
<p>Last night I appeared at the Opera, and shall do so twice a 
week till further notice.&nbsp; Friends I have seen but few; for 
I have not yet found time to do anything.&nbsp; Alfred Tennyson 
was here; but went off yesterday to consider the sea from the top
of Beachy Head.&nbsp; Carlyle gets on with his book which will be
in two big volumes.&nbsp; He has entirely misstated all about 
Naseby, after all my trouble. . . .</p>
<p>Did Churchyard see in London a picture at the address I 
enclose?&nbsp; The man&rsquo;s card, you see, proclaims 
&lsquo;Silversmith,&rsquo; but he is 
&lsquo;Pawnbroker.&rsquo;&nbsp; A <!-- page 191--><a 
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>picture 
hangs up at the door which he calls by &lsquo;Williams,&rsquo; 
but I think is a rather inferior Crome; though the figure in it 
is not like Crome&rsquo;s figures.&nbsp; The picture is about 
three feet high by two broad; good in the distance; very natural 
in the branching of the trees; heavy in the foliage; all common 
to Crome.&nbsp; And it seems painted in that fat substance he 
painted in.&nbsp; If C. come to London let him look at this 
picture, as well as come and see me.</p>
<p>I have cold, head-ache, and London disgust.&nbsp; Oh that I 
could look on my Anemones! and hear the sighing of my Scotch 
firs.&nbsp; The Exhibition is full of bad things: there is a 
grand Turner, however; quite unlike anything that was ever seen 
in Heaven above, or in Earth beneath, or in the waters under the 
Earth.</p>
<p>The reign of primroses and cowslips is over, and the oak now 
begins to take up the empire of the year and wear a budding 
garland about his brows.&nbsp; Over all this settles down the 
white cloud in the West, and the Morning and Evening draw toward 
Summer.</p>

<p>Had not your second note arrived this morning, I should surely
have written to you; that you might have a little letter for your
Sunday&rsquo;s breakfast.&nbsp; Do not accuse me of growing 
enamoured of London; I would have been in the country long ago if
I could. . . .&nbsp; <!-- page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span

the end of this month; and then I will go.&nbsp; I am not so bad 
as Tennyson, who has been for six weeks intending to start every 
day for Switzerland or Cornwall, he doesn&rsquo;t quite know 
which.&nbsp; However, his stay has been so much gain to me; for 
he and John Allen are the two men that give me pleasure here.</p>
<p>Tell Churchyard he must come up once again. . . .&nbsp; I saw 
a most lovely Sir Joshua at Christie&rsquo;s a week ago; it went 
far far above my means.&nbsp; There is an old hunting picture in 
Regent St. which I want him to look at.&nbsp; I think it is 
Morland; whom I don&rsquo;t care twopence for; the horses ill 
drawn; some good colour: the people English; good old 
England!&nbsp; I was at a party of modern wits last night that 
made me creep into myself, and wish myself away talking to any 
Suffolk old woman in her cottage, while the trees murmured 
without.&nbsp; The wickedness of London appals me; and yet I am 
no paragon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Frederic</span>,</p>
<p>Though I write from Boulge you are not to suppose I have been 
here ever since I last wrote to you.&nbsp; On the contrary, I am 
but just returned from London, where I spent a month, and saw all
the sights and all the people I cared to see.&nbsp; But what <!--
page 193--><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
193</span>am I to tell you of them?&nbsp; Spedding, you know, 
does not change: he is now the same that he was fourteen years 
old when I first knew him at school more than twenty years ago; 
wise, calm, bald, combining the best qualities of Youth and 
Age.&nbsp; And then as to things seen; you know that one 
Exhibition tells another, and one Panorama certifieth another, 
etc.&nbsp; If you want to know something of the Exhibition 
however, read Fraser&rsquo;s Magazine for this month; there 
Thackeray has a paper on the matter, full of fun.&nbsp; I met 
Stone in the street the other day; he took me by the button, and 
told me in perfect sincerity, and with increasing warmth, how, 
though he loved old Thackeray, yet these yearly out-speakings of 
his sorely tried him; not on account of himself (Stone), but on 
account of some of his friends, Charles Landseer, Maclise, 
etc.&nbsp; Stone worked himself up to such a pitch under the 
pressure of forced calmess that he at last said Thackeray would 
get himself horse-whipped one day by one of these infuriated 
Apelleses.&nbsp; At this I, who had partly agreed with Stone that
ridicule, though true, needs not always to be spoken, began to 
laugh: and told him two could play at that game.&nbsp; These 
painters cling together, and bolster each other up, to such a 
degree, that they really have persuaded themselves that any one 
who ventures to laugh at one of their drawings, exhibited 
publickly for the express purpose of criticism, insults the whole
corps.&nbsp; In the mean while old Thackeray laughs at all this; 
and goes on in his own way; writing hard for half a <!-- page 
194--><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
194</span>dozen Reviews and Newspapers all the morning; dining, 
drinking, and talking of a night; managing to preserve a fresh 
colour and perpetual flow of spirits under a wear-and-tear of 
thinking and feeding that would have knocked up any other man I 
know two years ago, at least. . . .</p>
<p>Alfred was in London the first week of my stay there.&nbsp; He
was looking well, and in good spirits; and had got two hundred 
lines of a new poem in a butcher&rsquo;s book.&nbsp; He went down
to Eastbourne in Sussex; where I believe he now is.&nbsp; He and 
I made a plan to go to the coast of Cornwall or Wales this 
summer; but I suppose we shall manage never to do it.&nbsp; I 
find I must go to Ireland; which I had not intended to do this 
year.</p>
<p>I have nothing new to tell you of Music.&nbsp; The Operas were
the same old affair; Linda di Chamouni, the Pirata, etc.&nbsp; 
Grisi coarse, . . . only Lablache great.&nbsp; There is one 
singer also, Brambelli, who, with a few husky notes, carries one 
back to the days of Pasta.&nbsp; I did not hear &lsquo;Le 
D&eacute;sert&rsquo;; but I fancy the English came to a fair 
judgment about it.&nbsp; That is, they did not want to hear it 
more than once.&nbsp; It was played many times, for new batches 
of people; but I doubt if any one went twice.&nbsp; So it is with
nearly all French things; there is a clever showy surface; but no
Holy of Holies far withdrawn; conceived in the depth of a mind, 
and only to be received into the depth of ours after much 
attention.&nbsp; Poussin must spend his life in Italy before he 
could paint as he <!-- page 195--><a name="page195"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 195</span>did; and what other Great Man, out 
of the exact Sciences, have they to show?&nbsp; This you will 
call impudence.&nbsp; Now Beethoven, you see by your own 
experience, has a depth not to be reached all at once.&nbsp; I 
admit with you that he is too bizarre, and, I think, morbid; but 
he is original, majestic, and profound.&nbsp; Such music 
<i>thinks</i>; so it is with Gluck; and with Mendelssohn.&nbsp; 
As to Mozart, he was, as a musical Genius, more wonderful than 
all.&nbsp; I was astonished at the Don Giovanni lately.&nbsp; It 
is certainly the Greatest Opera in the world.&nbsp; I went to no 
concert, and am now sorry I did not.</p>
<p>Now I have told you all my London news.&nbsp; You will not 
hear of my Cottage and Garden; so now I will shut up shop and 
have done.&nbsp; We have had a dismal wet May; but now June is 
recompensing us for all, and Dr. Blow may be said to be leading 
the great Garden Band in full chorus.&nbsp; This is a pun, which,
profound in itself, you must not expect to enjoy at first 
reading.&nbsp; I am not sure that I am myself conscious of the 
full meaning of it.&nbsp; I know it is very hot weather; the 
distant woods steaming blue under the noonday sun.&nbsp; I 
suppose you are living without clothes in wells, where you 
are.&nbsp; Remember me to your brothers; write soon; and believe 
me ever yours,</p>

fill the house I now stay in.&nbsp; In the bedroom I write in is 
Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s own bookcase and secretaire; with looking

shape.&nbsp; His own bed is also in the house; but I do not sleep
in it.</p>
<p>I am reading Selwyn&rsquo;s Correspondence, a remarkable book,

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Frederic</span>,</p>
<p>I have been wondering some time if you were gone abroad again 
or not.&nbsp; I go to London toward the end of April: can&rsquo;t
you manage to wait in England?&nbsp; I suppose you will only be a
day or two in London before you put foot in rail, coach, or on 
steamer for the Continent; and I excuse my own dastardly 
inactivity in not going up to meet you and shake hands with you 
before you start, by my old excuse; that had you but let me know 
of your coming to <!-- page 201--><a name="page201"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 201</span>England, I should have seen 
you.&nbsp; This is no excuse; but don&rsquo;t put me out of your 
books as a frog-hearted wretch.&nbsp; I believe that I, as men 
usually do, grow more callous and indifferent daily: but I am 
sure I would as soon travel to see your face, and my dear old 
Alfred&rsquo;s, as any one&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But beside my 
inactivity, I have a sort of horror of plunging into London; 
which, except for a shilling concert, and a peep at the pictures,
is desperate to me.&nbsp; This is my fault, not London&rsquo;s: I
know it is a lassitude and weakness of soul that no more loves 
the ceaseless collision of Beaux Esprits, than my obese 
ill-jointed carcase loves bundling about in coaches and 
steamers.&nbsp; And, as you say, the dirt, both of earth and 
atmosphere, in London, is a real bore.&nbsp; But enough of 
that.&nbsp; It is sufficient that it is more pleasant to me to 
sit in a clean room, with a clear air outside, and hedges just 
coming into leaf, rather than in the Tavistock or an upper floor 
of Charlotte Street.&nbsp; And how much better one&rsquo;s books 
read in country stillness, than amid the noise of wheels, crowds,
etc., or after hearing them eternally discussed by no less active
tongues!&nbsp; In the mean time, we of Woodbridge are not without
our luxuries; I enclose you a play-bill just received; <i>I</i>

in vain for a paper I wanted to send him.&nbsp; But, find it or 
not (and it is of no consequence) I will write to him very 
shortly.&nbsp; You do not mention if he be with you at 
Cheltenham.&nbsp; He spoke to me of being ill. . . .&nbsp; I 
think you should publish some of your poems.&nbsp; They must be 
admired and liked; and you would gain a place to which you are 
entitled, and which it offends no man to hold.&nbsp; I should 
like much to see them again.&nbsp; The whole <i>subjective</i> 
scheme (damn the word!) of the poems I did not like; but that is 
quite a genuine mould of your soul; and there are heaps of single
lines, couplets, and stanzas, which would consume all the ---, 
---, and ---, like stubble.&nbsp; N.B.&nbsp; An acute man would 
ask how I should like <i>you</i>, if I do not like your own 
genuine reflex of <i>you</i>?&nbsp; But a less acute, and an 
acuter, man, will feel or see the difference.</p>

<p>I was very sorry you did not come to us at Geldestone.&nbsp; I
have been home now near a fortnight; else I would gladly have 
gone to Mattishall with you yesterday.&nbsp; This very Sunday, on
which I now hear the Grundisburgh bells as I write, I might have 
been filled with the bread of Life from Padden&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>Our friend Barton is certainly one of the most remarkable men 
of the Age.&nbsp; After writing to Peel two separate Sonnets, 
begging him to retire to Tamworth and not alter the Corn Laws, he
finally sends him another letter to ask if he will be present at 
Lord Northampton&rsquo;s soir&eacute;e next Saturday; Barton 
himself being about to go to that soir&eacute;e, and wishing to 
see the Premier.&nbsp; On which Peel writes him a most good 
humoured note asking him to dine at Whitehall Gardens on that 
same Saturday!&nbsp; And the good Barton is going up for that 
purpose. <a name="citation203"></a><a href="#footnote203" 
class="citation">[203]</a>&nbsp; All this is great simplicity in 
Barton: and really announces an <!-- page 204--><a 
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>internal 
Faith that is creditable to this Age, and almost unexpected in 
it.&nbsp; I had advised him not to send Peel many more Sonnets 
till the Corn Law was passed; the Indian war arranged; and Oregon
settled: but Barton sees no dragon in the way.</p>
<p>We have actors now at Woodbridge.&nbsp; A Mr. Gill who was low
comedian in the Norwich now manages a troop of his own 
here.&nbsp; His wife was a Miss Vining; she is a pretty woman, 
and a lively pleasant actress, not vulgar.&nbsp; I have been to 
see some of the old comedies with great pleasure; and last night 
I sat in a pigeon-hole with David Fisher and &lsquo;revolved many
memories&rsquo; of old days and old plays.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t 
think he drinks so much now: but he looks all ready to blossom 
out into carbuncles.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know which of us is most to blame for this long 
gulph of silence.&nbsp; Probably I; who have least to do.&nbsp; I
have been for two months to London; where (had I thought it of 
any use) I should have written to try and get you up for a few 
days; as I had a convenient lodging, and many beside myself would
have been glad to see you.</p>
<p>I came back a week ago; and on looking in at Barton&rsquo;s 
last evening he showed me your letter with such pleasure as he is
wont to receive your letters with.&nbsp; And there I read all the
surprising story of <!-- page 207--><a name="page207"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 207</span>your moving to old Bury.&nbsp; When 
I passed through Cambridge two months ago, Thompson said (I 
think) that he had seen you; and that you had given up thoughts 
of Bury.&nbsp; But now you are going.&nbsp; As you say, you will 
then be nearer to us than you now are at Mattishall; especially 
when our Railroad shall be completed.&nbsp; In my journeys to and
from Bedfordshire, I shall hope to stay a night at the good old 
Angel, and so have a chat with you.</p>
<p>I saw very little of Spedding in London; for he was out all 
day at State paper offices and Museums; and I out by night at 
Operas, etc., with my Mother.&nbsp; He is however well and 
immutable.&nbsp; A. Tennyson was in London; for two months 
striving to spread his wings to Italy or Switzerland.&nbsp; It 
has ended in his flying to the Isle of Wight till Autumn, when 
Moxon promises to convoy him over; and then God knows what will 
become of him and whether we shall ever see his august old body 
over here again.&nbsp; He was in a ricketty state of body; 
brought on wholly by neglect, etc., but in fair spirits; and one 
had the comfort of seeing the Great Man.&nbsp; Carlyle goes on 
fretting and maddening as usual.&nbsp; Have you read his 
Cromwell?&nbsp; Are you converted, or did you ever need 
conversion?&nbsp; I believe I remain pretty much where I 
was.&nbsp; I think Milton, who is the best evidence Cromwell has 
in his favour, warns him somewhat prophetically at the end of his
Second Defence against taking on him <!-- page 208--><a 
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>Kingship, 
etc., and in the tract on the State of England in 1660 (just 
before it was determined to bring back Charles the Second) he 
says <i>nothing at all</i> of Cromwell, no panegyric; but glances
at the evil ambitious men in the Army have done; and, now that 
all is open to choose, prays for a pure Republic!&nbsp; So I herd
with the flunkies and lackies, I doubt; but am yours 
notwithstanding,</p>

<p>Here I am at last, after making a stay at Lowestoft, where I 
sailed in boats, bathed, and in all ways enjoyed the sea 
air.&nbsp; I wished for you upon a heathy promontory there, good 
museum for conversation on old poets, etc.&nbsp; What have you 
been reading, and what tastes of rare Authors have you to send 
me?&nbsp; I have read (as usual with me) but very little, what 
with looking at the sea with its crossing and recrossing ships, 
and dawdling with my nieces of an evening.&nbsp; Besides a book 
is to me what Locke says that watching the hour hand of a clock 
is to all; other thoughts (and those of the idlest and seemingly 
most irrelevant) will intrude between my vision and the written 
words: and then I have to read over again; often again and again 
till all is crossed and muddled.&nbsp; If Life were to be very 
much longer than is the usual lot of men, <!-- page 209--><a 
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>one would 
try very hard to reform this lax habit, and clear away such a 
system of gossamer association: even as it is, I try to turn all 
wandering fancy out of doors, and listen attentively to 
Whately&rsquo;s Logic, and old Spinoza still!&nbsp; I find some 
of Spinoza&rsquo;s Letters very good, and so far useful as that 
they try to clear up some of his abstrusities at the earnest 
request of friends as dull as myself.&nbsp; I think I perceive as
well as ever how the quality of his mind forbids much salutary 
instinct which widens the system of things to more ordinary men, 
and yet helps to keep them from wandering in it.&nbsp; I am now 
reading his Tractatus Theologico-Politicus, which is very 
delightful to me because of its clearness and acuteness.&nbsp; It
is fine what he says of Christ&mdash;&lsquo;<i>nempe</i>,&rsquo; 
that God revealed himself in bits to other prophets, but he was 
the mind of Christ.&nbsp; I suppose not new in thought or 
expression.</p>
<p>Let me hear from you, whether you have bits of revelations 
from old poets to send, or not.&nbsp; If I had the Mostellaria 
here, I would read it; or a Rabelais, I would do as Morgan 
Rattler advised you.</p>

<p>The weather is so ungenial, and likely to be so, that I put

I am to stay two days with the Hockleys, I would fain have 
tolerably fair days, and fair ways, for it: that one may get

thing: but I don&rsquo;t mean that.&nbsp; But any such trials of 
one&rsquo;s own show one the art of such dialogues as 
Plato&rsquo;s, where the process is so logical and conversational
at once: and the result so plain, and seemingly so easy.&nbsp; 
They remain the miracles of that Art to this day: and will do for
many a day: for I don&rsquo;t believe they will ever be

<p>Early in 1847 Carlyle received a communication from an unknown
correspondent, who professed to have in his possession a number 
of letters written by Cromwell and other documents, which if 
genuine were certainly of importance.&nbsp; As I published in the
Historical Review for April 1886 all the evidence which exists on
the subject, I shall not further dwell upon it here, except to 
say that I am not in the least convinced by the arguments which 
have been put forward that the thirty-five letters of Cromwell 
which Carlyle printed in Fraser&rsquo;s Magazine for 1847 were 
forged by his imperfectly educated correspondent William 
Squire.&nbsp; Squire was living at Yarmouth at this time, and as 
FitzGerald was frequently in his neighbourhood Carlyle asked him 
to endeavour to see him and examine the papers which he professed
to have.&nbsp; In reply to Carlyle&rsquo;s letter he wrote as 
follows in February 1847.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Carlyle</span>,</p>
<p>When I go into Norfolk, which will be some time this Spring, I
will go to Yarmouth and see for Mr. Squire, if you like.&nbsp; 
But if he is so rusty as you say, <!-- page 214--><a 
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>and as I 
also fancy, I doubt if he will open his treasures to any but to 
you who have already set him creaking.&nbsp; But we shall 
see.&nbsp; Some of his MS. extracts are curious and 
amusing.&nbsp; He writes himself something like Antony Wood, or 
some such ancient book-worm.&nbsp; It is also curious to hear of 
the old proud angry people about Peterboro&rsquo;, who 
won&rsquo;t show their records.</p>
<p>I have not seen the lives of the Saints you spoke of in a 
former letter.&nbsp; But when I go to London I must look out for 
a volume.&nbsp; I have begun to read Thucydides, which I never 
read before, and which does very well to hammer at for an hour in
a day: though I can&rsquo;t say I care much for the Greeks and 
their peddling quarrels; one must go to Rome for wars.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think Thackeray&rsquo;s Mrs. Perkins&rsquo;s 
Ball very good?&nbsp; I think the empty faces of the dance room 
were never better done.&nbsp; It seems to me wonderful that 
people can endure to look on such things: but I am forty, and got
out of the habit now, and certainly shall not try to get it back 
ever again.</p>
<p>I am glad you and Mrs. Carlyle happen to be in a milder part 
of England during this changeable and cold season.&nbsp; Yet, for
my own sake, I shall be sorry to see the winter go: with its 
decided and reasonable balance of daylight and candlelight.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t know when I shall go to London, perhaps in 
April.&nbsp; Please to remember me to Mrs. Carlyle.</p>

<p>I have had another letter from the Bartons asking about your 
advent.&nbsp; In fact Barton&rsquo;s daughter is anxious for her 
Father&rsquo;s to be done, and done this year.&nbsp; He is now 
sixty-three; and it won&rsquo;t do, you know, for 
grand-climacterical people to procrastinate&mdash;nay, to 
<i>proannuate</i>&mdash;which is a new, and, for all I see, a 
very bad word.&nbsp; But, be this as it may, do you come down to 
Woodbridge this summer if you can; and that you can, I doubt not;
since it is no great things out of your way to or from 
Norwich.</p>
<p>The means to get to Ipswich are&mdash;A steamboat will bring 
you for five shillings (a very pretty sail) from the Custom House
to Ipswich, the Orwell steamer; going twice a week, and heard of 
directly in the fishy latitudes of London Bridge.&nbsp; Or, a 
railroad brings you for the same sum; if you will travel third 
class, which I sometimes do in fine weather.&nbsp; I should 
recommend <i>that</i>; the time being so short, so certain: and 
no eating and drinking by the way, as must be in a steamer.&nbsp;
At Ipswich, I pick you up with the washerwoman&rsquo;s pony and 
take you to Woodbridge.&nbsp; There Barton sits with the tea 
already laid out; and Miss about to manage the urn; plain, 
agreeable people.&nbsp; At <!-- page 216--><a 
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>Woodbridge 
too is my little friend Churchyard, with whom we shall sup off 
toasted cheese and porter.&nbsp; Then, last and not least, the 
sweet retirement of Boulge: where the Graces and Muses, etc.</p>
<p>I write thus much because my friends seem anxious; my friend, 
I mean, Miss Barton: for Barton pretends he dreads having his 
portrait done; which is &lsquo;my eye.&rsquo;&nbsp; So come and 
do it.&nbsp; He is a generous, worthy, simple-hearted, fellow: 
worth ten thousand better wits.&nbsp; Then you shall see all the 
faded tapestry of country town life: London jokes worn 
threadbare; third rate accomplishments infinitely prized; scandal
removed from Dukes and Duchesses to the Parson, the Banker, the 
Commissioner of Excise, and the Attorney.</p>
<p>Let me hear from you soon that you are coming.&nbsp; I shall 
return to Boulge the end of this week.</p>
<p>P.S.&nbsp; Come if you can the latter part of the week; when 
the Quaker is most at leisure.&nbsp; There is a daily coach from 
Woodbridge to Norwich.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Carlyle</span>,</p>
<p>Last week I went over to Yarmouth and saw Squire.&nbsp; I was 
prepared, and I think you were, to find a quaint old gentleman of
the last century.&nbsp; Alas for guesses at History!&nbsp; I 
found a wholesome, <!-- page 217--><a name="page217"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 217</span>well-grown, florid, clear-eyed, 
open-browed, man of about my own age!&nbsp; There was no 
difficulty at all in coming to the subject at once, and tackling 
it.&nbsp; Squire is, I think, a straight-forward, choleric, 
ingenuous fellow&mdash;a little mad&mdash;cracks away at his 
family affairs.&nbsp; &lsquo;One brother is a 
rascal&mdash;another a spend-thrift&mdash;his father was of an 
amazing size&mdash;a prodigious eater, etc.&mdash;the family all 
gone to <i>smithers</i>,&rsquo; etc.&nbsp; I liked Squire well: 
and told him he must go to you; I am sure you will like him 
better than the London penny-a-liners.&nbsp; He is rather a 
study: and besides he can tell you bits of his Ancestor&rsquo;s 
journal; which will indeed make you tear your hair for what is 
burned&mdash;Between two and three hundred folio pages of MSS. by
a fellow who served under Oliver; been sent on secret service by 
him; dreaded him: but could not help serving him&mdash;Squire 
told me a few circumstances which he had picked up in running 
over the Journal before he burnt it; and which you ought to hear 
from himself before long.&nbsp; Dreadful stories of 
Oliver&rsquo;s severity; soldiers cut down by sabre on parade for
&lsquo;violence to women&rsquo;&mdash;a son shot on the spot just
before his Father&rsquo;s house for having tampered with 
Royalists&mdash;no quarter to spies&mdash;noses and ears of 
Royalists slit in retaliation of a like injury done to 
Roundheads;&mdash;many deeds which that ancient Squire witnessed,
or knew for certain, and which he and his successor thought 
severe and <i>cruel</i>:&mdash;but I <!-- page 218--><a 
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>could make 
out nothing unjust&mdash;I am very sure <i>you</i> would 
not.&nbsp; The Journalist told a story of Peterboro&rsquo; 
Cathedral like yours in your book about Ely:&mdash;Oliver 
marching in as the bells were ringing to service: bundling out 
canons, prebendaries, choristers, with the flat of the sword; and
then standing up to preach himself in his armour!&nbsp; A grand 
picture.&nbsp; Afterwards they broke the painted windows which I 
should count injudicious;&mdash;but that I sometimes feel a 
desire that some boys would go and do likewise to the Pusey 
<i>votive</i> windows; if you know that branch of art.</p>
<p>Ancestor Squire got angry with Oliver toward the end of the 
Journal; on some such account as this&mdash;Cromwell had promised
him a sum of money; but the ancestor got taken prisoner by pirate
or privateer before he went to claim the money; had to be 
redeemed by Oliver; and the redemption money was subtracted from 
the whole sum promised by Oliver when payment-time came.&nbsp; 
This proceeding seemed to both Squires, living and dead, shabby; 
but one not belonging to the family may be permitted to think it 
all fair.</p>
<p>On the whole, I suspect you would have used Ancestor Squire as
you have used many others who have helped you to materials of his
kind; like a sucked orange: you would have tossed him into the 
dirt carelessly, I doubt; and then what would Squire minor have 
said?&nbsp; Yet he himself did not like all his Ancestor had 
done; the <i>secret</i> service, which our <!-- page 219--><a 
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>Squire 
called &lsquo;<i>spy-age</i>&rsquo;; going to Holland with 
messages and despatches which he was to deliver to some one who 
was to meet him on the quay, and show him a gold ring; the man 
with the gold ring supposed to be the Stadtholder!&nbsp; I tried 
to persuade our friend there was no great shame in being an agent
of this sort; but he said with a light rap on the table that 
<i>he</i> wouldn&rsquo;t do such a thing.</p>
<p>I have now told you something of what remains in my head after
our conference; but you must see the man.&nbsp; What gave us the 
idea of his being old was his old-fashioned notions; he and his 
family have lived in Peterboro&rsquo; and such retired places 
these three hundred years; and amazing as it may seem to us that 
any people should be ashamed that their ancestors fought for Low 
Church, yet two hundred years are but as a day in a Cathedral 
Close.&nbsp; Nothing gives one more the idea of the Sleeping 
Palace than that.&nbsp; Esto perpetua!&nbsp; I mean, as long as I
live at least.&nbsp; When I expressed wonder to Squire that his 
wife&rsquo;s friends, or his Peterboro&rsquo; friends, should be 
so solicitous about the world&rsquo;s ever knowing that their 
ancestors had received letters from Cromwell, he very earnestly 
assured me that he knew some cases in which persons&rsquo; 
advancement in public life had been suddenly stopt by the Queen 
or her ministers, when it got wind that they were related in any 
way to Cromwell!&nbsp; I thought this a piece of dotage, as I do 
now; but I have heard elsewhere of some one not being allowed to 
take the name of Cromwell; I mean <!-- page 220--><a 
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>not very 
many years back; but more likely under a George than under a 
Victoria.</p>
<p>I think Squire must be a little crazy on this score; that is, 
the old dotage of a Cathedral town superstition worked up into 
activity by a choleric disposition.&nbsp; He seems, as I told 
you, of the sanguine temperament; and he mentioned a long illness
during which he was not allowed to read a book, etc., which looks
like some touch of the head.&nbsp; Perhaps brain fever.&nbsp; 
Perhaps no such thing, but all my fancy.&nbsp; He was very civil;
ordered in a bottle of Sherry and biscuits: asked me to dine, 
which I could not do.&nbsp; And so ends my long story.&nbsp; But 
you must see him.</p>

<p>He spoke of a portrait of Oliver that had been in his family 
since Oliver&rsquo;s time&mdash;till sold for a few shillings to 
some one in Norwich by some rascal relation.&nbsp; The portrait 
unlike all he has seen in painting or engraving: very pale, very 
thoughtful, very commanding, he says.&nbsp; If he ever recovers 
it, he will present you with it; he says if it should cost him

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Barton</span>,</p>
<p>. . . Here I am at Exeter: a place I never was in 
before.&nbsp; It is a fine country round about; and last <!-- 
page 221--><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
221</span>evening I saw landscape that would have made Churchyard
crazy.&nbsp; The Cathedral is not worth seeing to an ordinary 
observer, though I dare say Arch&aelig;ologists find it has its 
own private merits. . . .</p>
<p>Tell Churchyard we were wrong about Poussin&rsquo;s 
Orion.&nbsp; I found this out on my second visit to it.&nbsp; 
What disappointed me, and perhaps him, at first sight, was a 
certain stiffness in Orion&rsquo;s own figure; I expected to see 
him stalk through the landscape forcibly, as a giant usually 
does; but I forgot at the moment that Orion was <i>blind</i>, and
must walk as a blind man.&nbsp; Therefore this stiffness in his 
figure was just the right thing.&nbsp; I think however the 
picture is faulty in one respect, that the atmosphere of the 
landscape is not that of <i>dawn</i>; which it should be most 
visibly, since Morning is so principal an actor in the 
drama.&nbsp; All this seems to be more addressed to Churchyard, 
who has seen the picture, than to you who have not.</p>
<p>I saw also in London panoramas of Athens and the Himalaya 
mountains.&nbsp; In the latter, you see the Ganges glittering a 
hundred and fifty miles off; and far away the snowy peak of the 
mountain it rises from; that mountain 25,000 feet high.&nbsp; 
What&rsquo;s the use of coming to Exeter, when you can see all 
this for a shilling in London? . . .&nbsp; And now I am going to 
the Cathedral, where the Bishop has a cover to his seat sixty 
feet high.&nbsp; So now goodbye for the present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Barton</span>,</p>
<p>. . . After I wrote to you at Exeter, I went for three days to
the Devonshire coast; and then to Lusia&rsquo;s home in 
Somersetshire.&nbsp; I never saw her look better or 
happier.&nbsp; De Soyres pretty well; their little girl grown a 
pretty and strong child; their baby said to be very 
thriving.&nbsp; They live in a fine, fruitful, and picturesque 
country: green pastures, good arable, clothed with trees, bounded
with hills that almost reach mountain dignity, and in sight of 
the Bristol Channel which is there all but Sea.&nbsp; I fancy the
climate is moist, and I should think the trees are too many for 
health: but I was there too little time to quarrel with it on 
that score.&nbsp; After being there, I went to see a parson 
friend in Dorsetshire; <a name="citation222"></a><a 
href="#footnote222" class="citation">[222]</a> a quaint, humorous
man.&nbsp; Him I found in a most out-of-the-way parish in a fine 
open country; not so much wooded; chalk hills.&nbsp; This man 
used to wander about the fields at Cambridge with me when we both
wore caps and gowns, and then we proposed and discussed many 
ambitious schemes and subjects.&nbsp; He is now a quiet, 
saturnine, parson with five children, taking a pipe to soothe him
when they bother him with their noise or their misbehaviour: and 
I!&mdash;as the Bishop of London said, &lsquo;By the grace of God
I am what I am.&rsquo;&nbsp; In Dorsetshire I found the churches 
much occupied by Puseyite Parsons; <!-- page 223--><a 
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>new 
chancels built with altars, and painted windows that officiously 
displayed the Virgin Mary, etc.&nbsp; The people in those parts 
call that party &lsquo;Pugicides,&rsquo; and receive their 
doctrine and doings peacefully.&nbsp; I am vext at these silly 
men who are dishing themselves and their church as fast as they 
can.</p>

<p>I believe I must attribute your letter to your having skipped 
to Leghorn, and so got animated by the sight of a new 
place.&nbsp; <i>I</i> also am an Arcadian: have been to 
Exeter&mdash;the coast of Devonshire&mdash;the Bristol 
Channel&mdash;and to visit a Parson in Dorsetshire.&nbsp; He wore
cap and gown when I did at Cambridge&mdash;together did we roam 
the fields about Granchester, discuss all things, thought 
ourselves fine fellows, and that one day we should make a noise 
in the world.&nbsp; He is now a poor Rector in one of the most 
out-of-the-way villages in England&mdash;has five 
children&mdash;fats and kills his pig&mdash;smokes his 
pipe&mdash;loves his home and cares not ever to be seen or heard 
of out of it.&nbsp; I was amused with his company; he much 
pleased to see me: we had not met face to face for fifteen 
years&mdash;and now both of us such very sedate unambitious 
people!&nbsp; Now I am verging homeward; taking Leamington and 
Bedford in my way.</p>
<p><!-- page 224--><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Florence.&nbsp; It is only by chance that you give the name 
&lsquo;Villa Gondi&rsquo; of the house you describe so temptingly
to me.&nbsp; I should much like to visit you there; but I doubt 
shall never get up the steam for such an expedition.&nbsp; And 
now know that, since the last sentence was written, I have been 
to Cheltenham, and called at your Mother&rsquo;s; and seen her, 
and Matilda, and Horatio: all well: Alfred is with the 
Lushingtons and is reported to be all the better for the 
water-cure.&nbsp; Cheltenham seemed to me a woeful place: I had 
never seen it before.&nbsp; I now write from Leamington; where I 
am come to visit my Mother for a few days. . . .</p>
<p>All the world has been, as I suppose you have read, crazy 
about Jenny Lind: and they are now giving her &pound;400 to sing 
at a Concert.&nbsp; What a frightful waste of money!&nbsp; I did 
not go to hear her: partly out of contradiction perhaps; and 
partly because I could not make out that she was a great singer, 
like my old Pasta.&nbsp; Now I will go and listen to any pretty 
singer whom I can get to hear easily and unexpensively: but I 
will not pay and squeeze much for any canary in the world.&nbsp; 
Perhaps Lind is a nightingale: but I want something more than 
that.&nbsp; Spedding&rsquo;s cool blood was moved to hire stalls 
several times at an advanced rate: the Lushingtons (your sister 
told me) were enraptured: and certainly people rushed up madly 
from Suffolk to hear her but once and then die.&nbsp; I rather 
doubted the value of this <!-- page 225--><a 
name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>general 
appreciation.&nbsp; But one cause of my not hearing her was that 
I was not in London for more than a fortnight all the Spring: and
she came out but at the close of my fortnight. . . .</p>
<p>. . . You are wrong, as usual, about Moore and Eastlake: all 
the world say that Moore had much the best of the controversy, 
and Eastlake only remains cock of the walk because he is held up 
by authority.&nbsp; I do not pretend to judge which of the two is
right in art: but I am sure that Moore argues most logically, and
sets out upon finer principles; and if two shoemakers quarrelled 
about the making of a shoe, I should be disposed to side with him
who argued best on the matter, though my eyes and other senses 
could not help me to a verdict.&nbsp; Moore takes his stand on 
high ground, and appeals to Titian, Michel Angelo, and 
Reynolds.&nbsp; Eastlake is always shifting about, and appealing 
to Sir Robert Peel, Etty, and the Picture-dealers. <a

<p>. . . I assure you I am deeply obliged to you for the great 
trouble you have taken, and the kindness you have shewn about the
portrait.&nbsp; In spite of all our objections (yours amongst the
number) it is very like, <!-- page 226--><a 
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>and perhaps
only misses of being quite like by that much more than 
hairbreadth difference, which one would be foolish to expect to 
see adequated.&nbsp; Perhaps those painters are right who set out
with rather idealising the likeness of those we love; for we do 
so ourselves probably when we look at them.&nbsp; And as art must
miss the last delicacy of nature, it may be well to lean toward a
better than our eyes can affirm.</p>
<p>This is all wrong.&nbsp; Truth is the ticket; but those who 
like strongly, in this as in other cases, love to be a little 
blind, or to see too much.&nbsp; One fancies that no face can be 
too delicate and handsome to be the depository of a noble spirit:
and if we are not as good physiognomists as we are metaphysicians
(that is, intimate with any one particular mind) our outward eyes
will very likely be at variance with our inward, or rather be 
influenced by them.&nbsp; Very instructive all this!</p>

[20 <i>Septr</i>. 1847.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Carlyle</span>,</p>
<p>I was very glad of your letter: especially as regards that 
part in it about the Derbyshire villages.&nbsp; In many other 
parts of England (not to mention my own Suffolk) you would find 
the same substantial goodness <!-- page 227--><a 
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>among the 
people, resulting (as you say) from the funded virtues of many 
good humble men gone by.&nbsp; I hope you will continue to teach 
us all, as you have done, to make some use and profit of all 
this: at least, not to let what good remains to die away under 
penury and neglect.&nbsp; I also hope you will have some mercy 
now, and in future, on the &lsquo;Hebrew rags&rsquo; which are 
grown offensive to you; considering that it was these rags that 
really did bind together those virtues which have transmitted 
down to us all the good you noticed in Derbyshire.&nbsp; If the 
old creed was so commendably effective in the Generals and 
Counsellors of two hundred years ago, I think we may be well 
content to let it work still among the ploughmen and weavers of 
to-day; and even to suffer some absurdities in the Form, if the 
Spirit does well upon the whole.&nbsp; Even poor Exeter Hall 
ought, I think, to be borne with; it is at least better than the 
wretched Oxford business.&nbsp; When I was in Dorsetshire some 
weeks ago, and saw chancels done up in sky-blue and gold, with 
niches, candles, an <i>Altar</i>, rails to keep off the profane 
laity, and the parson (like your Reverend Mr. Hitch <a 
name="citation227"></a><a href="#footnote227" 
class="citation">[227]</a>) <i>intoning</i> with his back to the 
people, I thought the Exeter Hall war-cry of &lsquo;The 
Bible&mdash;the whole Bible&mdash;and nothing but the 
Bible&rsquo; a good cry: I wanted Oliver and his dragoons to 
march in and put an end to it all.&nbsp; Yet our Established 
Parsons (when quiet and in their senses) make good country 
gentlemen, and magistrates; and <!-- page 228--><a 
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>I am glad 
to secure one man of means and education in each parish of 
England: the people can always resort to Wesley, Bunyan, and 
Baxter, if they want stronger food than the old Liturgy, and the 
orthodox Discourse.&nbsp; I think you will not read what I have 
written: or be very bored with it.&nbsp; But it is written 
now.</p>
<p>I am going to-day into the neighbourhood of Kimbolton: but 
shall be back here by the end of the week: and shall not leave 
Bedford till next Monday certainly.&nbsp; I may then go to Naseby
for three days: but this depends.&nbsp; I would go and hunt up 
some of the Peterboro&rsquo; churchmen for you; but that my 
enquiries would either be useless, or precipitate the burning of 
other records.&nbsp; I hope your excursion will do you 
good.&nbsp; Thank you for your account of Spedding: I had written
however to himself, and from himself ascertained that he was out 
of the worst.&nbsp; But Spedding&rsquo;s life is a very ticklish 
one.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>To E. B. Cowell</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[1847]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Cowell</span>,</p>
<p>. . . I am only got half way in the third book of Thucydides: 
but I go on with pleasure; with as much pleasure as I used to 
read a novel.&nbsp; I have also again taken up my Homer.&nbsp; 
That is a noble and affecting passage where Diomed and Glaucus, 
being about to fight, recognize each other as old family friends,
<!-- page 229--><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
229</span>exchange arms, and vow to avoid each other henceforth 
in the fray.&nbsp; (N.B. and this in the tenth year of the 
war!)&nbsp; After this comes, you know, the meeting of Hector and
Andromache, which we read together; altogether a truly Epic canto
indeed.</p>
<p>Yet, as I often think, it is not the poetical imagination, but
bare Science that every day more and more unrolls a greater Epic 
than the Iliad; the history of the World, the infinitudes of 
Space and Time!&nbsp; I never take up a book of Geology or 
Astronomy but this strikes me.&nbsp; And when we think that Man 
must go on to discover in the same plodding way, one fancies that
the Poet of to-day may as well fold his hands, or turn them to 
dig and delve, considering how soon the march of discovery will 
distance all his imaginations, [and] dissolve the language in 
which they are uttered.&nbsp; Martial, as you say, lives now, 
after two thousand years; a space that seems long to us whose 
lives are so brief; but a moment, the twinkling of an eye, if 
compared (not to Eternity alone) but to the ages which it is now 
known the world must have existed, and (unless for some external 
violence) must continue to exist.&nbsp; Lyell in his book about 
America, says that the falls of Niagara, if (as seems certain) 
they have worked their way back southwards for seven miles, must 
have taken over 35,000 years to do so, at the rate of something 
over a foot a year!&nbsp; Sometimes they fall back on a stratum 
that crumbles away from behind them more easily: but then again 
<!-- page 230--><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
230</span>they have to roll over rock that yields to them 
scarcely more perceptibly than the anvil to the serpent.&nbsp; 
And those very soft strata which the Cataract now erodes contain 
evidences of a race of animals, and of the action of seas washing
over them, long before Niagara came to have a distinct current; 
and the rocks were compounded ages and ages before those 
strata!&nbsp; So that, as Lyell says, the Geologist looking at 
Niagara forgets even the roar of its waters in the contemplation 
of the awful processes of time that it suggests.&nbsp; It is not 
only that this vision of Time must wither the Poet&rsquo;s hope 
of immortality; but it is in itself more wonderful than all the 
conceptions of Dante and Milton.</p>
<p>As to your friend Pliny, I don&rsquo;t think that Time can use
his usual irony on that saying about Martial. <a 
name="citation230a"></a><a href="#footnote230a" 
class="citation">[230a]</a>&nbsp; Pliny evidently only suggests 
that &lsquo;at non erunt &aelig;terna qu&aelig; scripsit&rsquo; 
as a question of his correspondent; to which he himself replies 
&lsquo;Non erunt <i>fortasse</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; Your Greek 
quotations are very graceful.&nbsp; I should like to read 
Busbequius. <a name="citation230b"></a><a href="#footnote230b"

hiatus you made? or is the inconsequence only in my brains?&nbsp;
So much for the legend: and I must reprehend you for one tiny bit

and now you are not there I have one reason the less for going 
there.&nbsp; I want to settle myself in some town&mdash;for 
good&mdash;for life!&nbsp; A pleasant <!-- page 235--><a 
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>country 
town, a cathedral town perhaps!&nbsp; What sort of a place is 
Lichfield?</p>
<p>I say nothing about French Revolutions, which are too big for 
a little letter.&nbsp; I think we shall all be in a war before 
the year; I know not how else the French can keep peace at home 
but by quarrelling abroad.&nbsp; But &lsquo;come what come 
may.&rsquo;</p>
<p>My old friend Major Moor died rather suddenly last Saturday: 
<a name="citation235"></a><a href="#footnote235" 
class="citation">[235]</a> and this next Saturday is to be buried
in the Church to which he used to take me when I was a boy.&nbsp;
He has not left a better man behind him.</p>

<p>. . . I suppose by a &lsquo;Minster Pool&rsquo; in Lichfield 
you mean a select coterie of Prebends, Canons, etc.&nbsp; These 
would never trouble me.&nbsp; I should much prefer the society of
the Doctor, the Lawyer (if tolerably honest) and the singing 
men.&nbsp; I love a small Cathedral town; and the dignified 
respectability of the Church potentates is a part of the 
pleasure.&nbsp; I sometimes think of Salisbury: and have 
altogether long had an idea of settling at forty years old.&nbsp;
Perhaps it will be at Woodbridge, after all!</p>

<p>When you talk of two idle men not taking the trouble to keep 
up a little intercourse by letters, you do not, in conscience, 
reflect upon me; who, you know, am very active in answering 
almost by return of post.&nbsp; It is some six months since you 
must have got my last letter, full of most instructive advice 
concerning my namesake; of whom, and of which, you say 
nothing.&nbsp; How much has he borrowed of you?&nbsp; Is he now 
living on the top of your hospitable roof?&nbsp; Do you think him
the most ill-used of men?&nbsp; I see great advertisements in the
papers about your great Grimsby Railway. . . .&nbsp; Does it pay?
does it pay all but you? who live only on the fine promises of 
the lawyers and directors engaged in it?&nbsp; You know England 
has had a famous winter of it for commercial troubles: my family 
has not escaped the agitation: I even now doubt if I must not 
give up my daily two-pennyworth of cream and take to milk: and 
give up my Spectator and Athen&aelig;um.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t 
trouble myself much about all this: for, unless the kingdom goes 
to pieces by national bankruptcy, I shall probably have enough to
live on: and, luckily, every year I want less.&nbsp; What do you 
think of my not going up to London this year; to see exhibitions,
to hear operas, and so on?&nbsp; Indeed I do not think I shall 
go: and I <!-- page 237--><a name="page237"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 237</span>have no great desire to go.&nbsp; I 
hear of nothing new in any way worth going up for.&nbsp; I have 
never yet heard the famous Jenny Lind, whom all the world raves 
about.&nbsp; Spedding is especially mad about her, I understand: 
and, after that, is it not best for weaker vessels to keep out of
her way?&nbsp; Night after night is that bald head seen in one 
particular position in the Opera house, in a stall; the miserable
man has forgot Bacon and philosophy, and goes after strange 
women.&nbsp; There is no doubt this lady is a wonderful singer; 
but I will not go into hot crowds till another Pasta comes; I 
have heard no one since her worth being crushed for.&nbsp; And to
perform in one&rsquo;s head one of Handel&rsquo;s choruses is 
better than most of the Exeter Hall performances.&nbsp; I went to
hear Mendelssohn&rsquo;s Elijah last spring: and found it 
wasn&rsquo;t at all worth the trouble.&nbsp; Though very good 
music it is not original: Haydn much better.&nbsp; I think the 
day of Oratorios is gone, like the day for painting Holy 
Families, etc.&nbsp; But we cannot get tired of what has been 
done in Oratorios more than we can get tired of Raffaelle.&nbsp; 
Mendelssohn is really original and beautiful in <i>romantic</i> 
music: witness his Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream, and 
Fingal&rsquo;s Cave.</p>
<p>I had a note from Alfred three months ago.&nbsp; He was then 
in London: but is now in Ireland, I think, adding to his new 
poem, the Princess.&nbsp; Have you seen it?&nbsp; I am considered
a great heretic for abusing it; it seems to me a wretched waste 
of power at a time of life when a man ought to be doing his best;
<!-- page 238--><a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
238</span>and I almost feel hopeless about Alfred now.&nbsp; I 
mean, about his doing what he was born to do. . . .&nbsp; On the 
other hand, Thackeray is progressing greatly in his line: he 
publishes a Novel in numbers&mdash;Vanity Fair&mdash;which began 
dull, I thought: but gets better every number, and has some very 
fine things indeed in it.&nbsp; He is become a great man I am 
told: goes to Holland House, and Devonshire House: and for some 
reason or other, will not write a word to me.&nbsp; But I am sure
this is not because he is asked to Holland House.&nbsp; Dickens 
has fallen off in his last novel, <a name="citation238"></a><a 
href="#footnote238" class="citation">[238]</a> just completed; 
but there are wonderful things in it too.&nbsp; Do you ever get a
glimpse of any of these things?</p>
<p>As to public affairs, they are so wonderful that one does not 
know where to begin.&nbsp; If England maintains her own this 
year, she must have the elements of long lasting in her.&nbsp; I 
think People begin to wish we had no more to do with Ireland: but
the Whigs will never listen to a doctrine which was never heard 
of in Holland House.&nbsp; I am glad Italy is free: and surely 
there is nothing for her now but a Republic.&nbsp; It is well to 
stand by old kings who have done well by us: but it is too late 
in the day to <i>begin</i> Royalty.</p>
<p>If anything could tempt me so far as Italy, it would certainly
be your presence in Florence.&nbsp; But I boggle about going 
twenty miles, and <i>cui bono</i>? deadens me more and more.</p>

ago, when I was obliged to go up to London on business. . . 
.&nbsp; I saw Alfred, and the rest of the s&ccedil;avans.&nbsp; 
Thackeray is a great man: goes to Devonshire House, etc.: and 
<i>his</i> book (which is capital) is read by the Great: and 
will, I hope, do them good.&nbsp; I heard but little music: the 
glorious Acis and Galatea; and the redoubtable Jenny Lind, for 
the first time.&nbsp; I was disappointed in her: but am told this
is all my fault.&nbsp; As to naming her in the same Olympiad with
great old Pasta, I am sure that is ridiculous.&nbsp; The 
Exhibition is like most others you have seen; worse 
perhaps.&nbsp; There is an &lsquo;Aaron&rsquo; and a &lsquo;John 
the Baptist&rsquo; by Etty far worse than the Saracen&rsquo;s 
Head on Ludgate Hill.&nbsp; Moore is turned Picture dealer: and 
that high Roman virtue in which he indulged is likely to suffer a
Picture-dealer&rsquo;s change, I think.&nbsp; Carlyle writes in 
the Examiner about Ireland: raves and foams, but has nothing to 
propose.&nbsp; Spedding prospers with Bacon.&nbsp; Alfred seemed 
to me in fair plight: much dining out: and his last Poem is well 
liked I believe.&nbsp; Morton is still at Lisbon, I believe also:
but I have not written to him, nor heard from him.&nbsp; And now,
my dear Frederic, I must shut up.&nbsp; Do not neglect to write 
to me sometimes.&nbsp; Alfred said you ought to be in England 
about your Grimsby Land.</p>

imagination in recording such things as Alcibiades at Lampsacus; 
<a name="citation240"></a><a href="#footnote240"

Sophocles, I will not give up my old Titan.&nbsp; Is there not an
infusion of Xenophon in Sophocles, as compared to 
&AElig;schylus,&mdash;a dilution?&nbsp; Sophocles is doubtless 
the better artist, the more complete; but are we to expect 
anything but glimpses and ruins of the divinest?&nbsp; Sophocles 
is a pure Greek temple; but &AElig;schylus is a rugged mountain, 
lashed by seas, and riven by thunderbolts: and which is the most 
wonderful, and appalling?&nbsp; Or if one will have 
&AElig;schylus too a work of man, I say he is like a Gothic 
Cathedral, which the Germans say did arise from the genius of man
aspiring up to the immeasurable, and reaching after the infinite 
in complexity and gloom, according as Christianity elevated and 
widened men&rsquo;s minds.&nbsp; A dozen lines of &AElig;schylus 
have a more Almighty power on me than all Sophocles&rsquo; plays;
though I would perhaps rather save Sophocles, as the consummation
of Greek art, than &AElig;schylus&rsquo; twelve lines, if it came
to a choice which must be lost.&nbsp; <!-- page 241--><a

<p>You have sent me two or three kind messages through 
Barton.&nbsp; I hear you come into Suffolk the middle of 
January.&nbsp; My movements are as yet uncertain; the lawyers may
call me back to London very suddenly: but should I be here at the
time of your advent, you must really contrive to come here, to 
this Cottage, for a day or two.&nbsp; I have yet beds, tables, 
and chairs for two: I think Gurdon is also looking out for 
you.</p>
<p>I only returned home a few days ago, to spend Christmas with 
Barton: whose turkey I accordingly partook of.&nbsp; He seems 
only pretty well: is altered during the last year: less spirits, 
less strength; but quite amiable still.</p>
<p>I saw many of my friends in London, Carlyle and Tennyson among
them; but most and best of all, Spedding.&nbsp; I have stolen his
noble book <a name="citation241"></a><a href="#footnote241" 
class="citation">[241]</a> away from him; noble, in spite (I 
believe, but am not sure) of some <i>adikology</i> in the second 
volume: some special pleadings for his idol: amica Veritas, sed 
magis, etc.&nbsp; <!-- page 242--><a name="page242"></a><span

the intolerance of a weak stomach.</p>
<p>I also went to plays and concerts which I could scarce afford:
but I thought I would have a Carnival before entering on a year 
of reductions.&nbsp; I have been trying to hurry on, and bully, 
Lawyers: have done a very little good with much trouble; and 
cannot manage to fret much though I am told there is great cause 
for fretting.</p>

<p>I see a good deal of Alfred, who lives not far off me: and he 
is still the same noble and droll fellow he used to be.&nbsp; A 
lithograph has been made from Laurence&rsquo;s portrait of him; 
<i>my</i> portrait: and six copies are given to me.&nbsp; I 
reserve one for you; how can I send it to you?</p>
<p>Laurence has for months been studying the Venetian secret of 
colour in company with Geldart; and at last they have discovered 
it, they say.&nbsp; I have seen some of Laurence&rsquo;s 
portraits done on his new system; they seem to be really much 
better up to a certain point of progress: but I think he is apt, 
by a bad choice of colours, to spoil the effect which an improved
<!-- page 244--><a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
244</span>system of laying on the colours should ensure.&nbsp; 
But he has only lately begun on his new system, of which he is 
quite confident; and perhaps all will come right by and by.</p>
<p>I have seen Thackeray three or four times.&nbsp; He is just 
the same.&nbsp; All the world admires Vanity Fair; and the Author
is courted by Dukes and Duchesses, and wits of both sexes.&nbsp; 
I like Pendennis much; and Alfred said he thought &lsquo;it was 
quite delicious: it seemed to him so <i>mature</i>,&rsquo; he 
said.&nbsp; You can imagine Alfred saying this over one&rsquo;s 
fire, spreading his great hand out.</p>

<p>I often think of you: often wish to write to you&mdash;often 
intend to do so&mdash;determine to do so&mdash;but perhaps should
not do so for a long time, but that this sheet of thin paper 
happens to come under my fingers this 19th of June 1849.&nbsp; 
You must not believe however that it is only chance that puts me 
up to this exertion; I really should have written before but that
the reports we read of Italian and Florentine troubles put me in 
doubt first whether you are still at Florence to receive my 
letter: and secondly whether, if you be there, it would ever 
reach your hands.&nbsp; But I will brace myself up even to that 
great act of Friendship, to write a long letter with all 
probability of its miscarrying.&nbsp; <!-- page 245--><a 
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>Only look 
here; if it ever does reach you, you must really write to me 
directly: to let me know how you and yours are, for I am 
sincerely anxious to know this.&nbsp; I saw great reports in the 
paper too some months back of Prince Albert going to open Great 
Grimsby Docks.&nbsp; Were not such Docks to be made on your land?
and were you not to be a rich man if they were made?&nbsp; And 
have you easily consented to forego being paid in money, and to 
accept in lieu thereof a certain quantity of wholly valueless 
shares in said Docks, which will lead you into expense, instead 
of enriching you?&nbsp; This is what I suppose will be the 
case.&nbsp; For though you have a microscopic eye for human 
character, you are to be diddled by any knave, or set of knaves, 
as you well know.</p>
<p>Of my own affairs I have nothing agreeable to tell. . . 
.&nbsp; When I met you in London, I was raising money for myself 
on my reversionary property: and so I am still: and of course the
lawyers continue to do so in the most expensive way; a slow 
torture of the purse.&nbsp; But do not suppose I want money: I 
get it, at a good price: nor do I fret myself about the price: 
there will be quite enough (if public securities hold) for my 
life under any dispensation the lawyers can inflict.&nbsp; As I 
grow older I want less.&nbsp; I have not bought a book or a 
picture this year: have not been to a concert, opera, or play: 
and, what is more, I don&rsquo;t care to go.&nbsp; Not but if I 
meet you in London again I shall break out into shilling 
concerts, etc., and shall be glad of the opportunity.</p>
<p><!-- page 246--><a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>After you left London, I remained there nearly to the 
end of December; saw a good deal of Alfred, etc.&nbsp; Since then
I have been down here except a fortnight&rsquo;s stay in London, 
from which I have just returned.&nbsp; I heard Alfred had been 
seen flying through town to the Lushingtons: but I did not see 
him.&nbsp; He is said to be still busy about that accursed 
Princess.&nbsp; By the by, beg, borrow, steal, or buy 
Keats&rsquo; Letters and Poems; most wonderful bits of Poems, 
written off hand at a sitting, most of them: I only wonder that 
they do not make a noise in the world.&nbsp; By the by again, it 
is quite necessary <i>your</i> poems should be printed; which 
Moxon, I am sure, would do gladly.&nbsp; Except this book of 
Keats, we have had <i>no</i> poetry lately, I believe; luckily, 
the ---, ---, ---, etc., are getting older and past the age of 
conceiving&mdash;<i>wind</i>.&nbsp; Send your poems over to 
Alfred to sort and arrange for you: he will do it: and you and he
are the only men alive whose poems I want to see in print.&nbsp; 
By the by, thirdly and lastly, and in total contradiction to the 
last sentence, I am now helping to edit some letters and poems 
of&mdash;Bernard Barton!&nbsp; Yes: the poor fellow died suddenly
of heart disease; leaving his daughter, a noble woman, almost 
unprovided for: and we are getting up this volume by 
subscription.&nbsp; If you were in England <i>you</i> must 
subscribe: but as you are not, you need only give us a share in 
the Great Grimsby Dock instead.</p>
<p>Now there are some more things I could tell you, but you see 
where my pen has honestly got to in the <!-- page 247--><a 
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
247</span>paper.&nbsp; I remember you did not desire to hear 
about my garden, which is now gorgeous with large red poppies, 
and lilac irises&mdash;satisfactory colouring: and the trees 
murmur a continuous soft <i>chorus to the solo which my soul 
discourses within</i>.&nbsp; If that be not Poetry, I should like
to know what is? and with it I may as well conclude.&nbsp; I 
think I shall send this letter to your family at Cheltenham to be
forwarded to you:&mdash;they may possibly have later intelligence
of you than I have.&nbsp; Pray write to me if you get this; 
indeed you <i>must</i>; and never come to England without letting
me know of it.</p>

<p>Warren&rsquo;s analysis of my MS. is rather wonderful to 
me.&nbsp; Though not wholly correct (as I think, and as I will 
expound to you one day) it seems to me yet as exact as most of my
friends who know me best could draw out from their personal 
knowledge.&nbsp; Some of his guesses (though partly right) hit 
upon traits of character I should conceive quite out of all 
possibility of solution from mere handwriting.&nbsp; I can 
understand that a man should guess at one&rsquo;s temperament, 
whether lively or slow; at one&rsquo;s habit of thought, whether 
<!-- page 248--><a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
248</span>diffuse or logical; at one&rsquo;s Will, whether strong
and direct or feeble and timid.&nbsp; But whether one distrusts 
men, and yet trusts friends?&nbsp; Half of this is true, at all 
events.&nbsp; Then I cannot conceive how a man should see in 
handwriting such an accident as whether one knew much of Books or
men; and in this point it is very doubtful if Warren is 
right.&nbsp; But, take it all in all, his analysis puzzles me 
much.&nbsp; I have sent it to old Jem Spedding the Wise.&nbsp; 
You shall have it again.</p>
<p>If my Mother should remain at this place you must one day come

<p>Your note came to me to-day.&nbsp; I ought to have written to 
you long ago: and indeed did half do a letter before the summer 
was half over: which letter I mislaid.&nbsp; I shall be delighted
indeed to have your photograph: insufficient as a photograph 
is.&nbsp; You are one of the few men whose portrait I would give 
a penny to have: and one day when you are in England we must get 
it done by Laurence; half at your expense <!-- page 250--><a 
name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>and half at
mine, I think.&nbsp; I wish you had sent over to me some of your 
poems which you told me you were printing at Florence: and often 
I wish I was at Florence to give you some of my self-satisfied 
advice on what you should select.&nbsp; For though I do not 
pretend to write Poetry you know I have a high notion of my 
judgment in it.</p>
<p>Well, I was at Boulge all the summer: came up thence five 
weeks ago: stayed three weeks with my mother at Richmond; a week 
in London: and now am come here to try and finish a money bargain
with some lawyers which you heard me beginning a year ago.&nbsp; 
They utterly failed in any part of the transaction except 
bringing me in a large bill for service unperformed.&nbsp; 
However, we are now upon another tack. . . .</p>
<p>In a week I go to London, where I hope to see Alfred.&nbsp; 
Oddly enough, I had a note from him this very day on which I 
receive yours: he has, he tells me, taken chambers in 
Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields.&nbsp; Moxon told me he was about to 
publish another edition of his Princess, with interludes added 
between the parts: and also that he was about to print, but (I 
think) not to publish, those Elegiacs on Hallam.&nbsp; I saw poor
old Thackeray in London: getting very slowly better of a bilious 
fever that had almost killed him.&nbsp; Some one told me that he 
was gone or going to the Water Doctor at Malvern.&nbsp; People in
general thought Pendennis got dull as it got on; and I confess I 
thought so too: he would do well to take the opportunity <!-- 
page 251--><a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
251</span>of his illness to discontinue it altogether.&nbsp; He 
told me last June he himself was tired of it: must not his 
readers naturally tire too?&nbsp; Do you see Dickens&rsquo; David
Copperfield?&nbsp; It is very good, I think: more carefully 
written than his later works.&nbsp; But the melodramatic parts, 
as usual, bad.&nbsp; Carlyle says he is a showman whom one gives 
a shilling to once a month to see his raree-show, and then sends 
him about his business.</p>
<p>I have been obliged to turn Author on the very smallest 
scale.&nbsp; My old friend Bernard Barton chose to die in the 
early part of this year. . . .&nbsp; We have made a Book out of 
his Letters and Poems, and published it by subscription . . . and
I have been obliged to contribute a little dapper <a 
name="citation251"></a><a href="#footnote251" 
class="citation">[251]</a> Memoir, as well as to select bits of 
Letters, bits of Poems, etc.&nbsp; All that was wanted is 
accomplished: many people subscribed.&nbsp; Some of B. B.&rsquo;s
letters are pleasant, I think, and when you come to England I 
will give you this little book of incredibly small value.&nbsp; I
have heard no music but two concerts at Jullien&rsquo;s a 
fortnight ago; very dull, I thought: no beautiful new Waltzes and
Polkas which I love.&nbsp; It is a strange thing to go to the 
Casinos and see the coarse whores and apprentices in bespattered 
morning dresses, pea-jackets, and bonnets, twirl round clumsily 
and indecently to the divine airs played in the Gallery; 
&lsquo;the music yearning like a God in pain&rsquo; indeed.&nbsp;
I should like to hear <!-- page 252--><a name="page252"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 252</span>some of your Florentine Concerts; 
and I do wish you to believe that I do constantly wish myself 
with you: that, if I ever went anywhere, I would assuredly go to 
visit the Villa Gondi.&nbsp; I wish you to believe this, which I 
know to be true, though I am probably further than ever from 
accomplishing my desire.&nbsp; Farewell: I shall hope to find out
your Consul and your portrait in London: though you do not give 
me very good directions where I am to find them.&nbsp; And I will
let you know soon whether I have found the portrait, and how I 
like it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Donne</span>,</p>
<p>. . . After I left Richmond, whence I last wrote to you, I 
went to Bedford, where I was for five weeks: then returned to 
spend Christmas at Richmond: and now dawdle here hoping to get 
some accursed lawyers to raise me some money on what remains of 
my reversion.&nbsp; This they <i>can</i> do, and <i>will</i> do, 
in time: but, as usual, find it their interest to delay as much 
as possible.</p>
<p>I found A. Tennyson in chambers at Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn: and 
recreated myself with a sight of his fine old mug, and got out of
him all his dear old stories, and many new ones.&nbsp; He is 
re-publishing his Poems, the Princess with songs 
interposed.&nbsp; I cannot say I thought them like the old 
vintage of his earlier days, though perhaps better than other 
people&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But, even to you, such opinions appear 
blasphemies.&nbsp; A. T. is now gone on a visit into 
Leicestershire: and I miss him greatly.&nbsp; Carlyle I have not 
seen; but I read an excellent bit of his in the Examiner, about 
Ireland.&nbsp; <!-- page 254--><a name="page254"></a><span

quite strong yet.&nbsp; Spedding is not yet returned: and I doubt
will not return before I have left London.</p>
<p>I have been but to one play; to see the Hypocrite, and Tom 
Taylor&rsquo;s burlesque <a name="citation254a"></a><a 
href="#footnote254a" class="citation">[254a]</a>&nbsp; at the

thought.&nbsp; He has written songs to be stuck between the 
cantos of the Princess, none of them of the old champagne 
flavour, as I think.&nbsp; But I am in a minority about the 
Princess, I believe.&nbsp; If you print any poems, I especially 
desire you will transmit them to me.&nbsp; I wish I was with you 
to consider about these: for though I cannot write poems, you 
know I consider that I have the old woman&rsquo;s faculty of 
judging of them: yes, much better than much <!-- page 255--><a

of you: and, as I have often sincerely told you, with a kind of 
love which I feel towards but two or three friends.&nbsp; Are you
coming to England?&nbsp; How goes on Grimsby!&nbsp; Doesn&rsquo;t
the state of Europe sicken you?&nbsp; Above all, let me have any 
poems you print: you are now the only man I expect verse from; 
such gloomy grand stuff as you write.&nbsp; Thackeray, to be 
sure, can write good ballads, half serious.&nbsp; His Pendennis 
is very stupid, I think: Dickens&rsquo; Copperfield on the whole,
very good.&nbsp; He always lights one up somehow.&nbsp; There is 
a new volume of posthumous poems by Ebenezer Elliott: with fine 
things in it.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t find myself growing old about 
Poetry; on the contrary.&nbsp; I wish I could take twenty years 
off Alfred&rsquo;s shoulders, and set him up in his youthful 
glory: . . .&nbsp; He is the same magnanimous, kindly, delightful
fellow as ever; uttering by far the finest prose sayings of any 
one.</p>

one sees indications of lovely spring <!-- page 256--><a 
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
256</span>about.&nbsp; I have read but very little of late; 
indeed my eyes have not been in superfine order.&nbsp; I caught a
glimpse of the second volume of Southey&rsquo;s Life and Letters;
interesting enough.&nbsp; I have also bought Emerson&rsquo;s 
&lsquo;Representative Men,&rsquo; a shilling book of 
Bohn&rsquo;s: with very good scattered thoughts in it: but 
scarcely leaving any large impression with one, or establishing a
theory.&nbsp; So at least it has seemed to me: but I have not 
read very carefully.&nbsp; I have also bought a little posthumous
volume of Ebenezer Elliott: which is sure to have fine things in 
it.</p>
<p>I believe I love poetry almost as much as ever: but then I 
have been suffered to doze all these years in the enjoyment of 
old childish habits and sympathies, without being called on to 
more active and serious duties of life.&nbsp; I have not put away
childish things, though a man.&nbsp; But, at the same time, this 
visionary inactivity is better than the mischievous activity of 
so many I see about me; not better than the useful and virtuous 
activity of a few others: John Allen among the number.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Frederic</span>,</p>
<p>You tell me to write soon: and this letter is begun, at least,
on the day yours reaches me.&nbsp; This is partly owing to my 
having to wait an hour here in the Coffee <!-- page 257--><a 
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>room of the
Portland Hotel: whither your letter has been forwarded to me from
Boulge.&nbsp; I am come up for one week: once more to haggle with
Lawyers; once more to try and settle my own affairs as well as 
those of others for a time. . . .</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think of drowning myself yet: and what I wrote 
to you was a sort of safety escape for my poor flame . . .&nbsp; 
It is only idle and well-to-do people who kill themselves; it is 
ennui that is hopeless: great pain of mind and body &lsquo;still,
still, on hope relies&rsquo;: the very old, the very wretched, 
the most incurably diseased never put themselves to rest.&nbsp; 
It really gives me pain to hear you or any one else call me a 
philosopher, or any good thing of the sort.&nbsp; I am none, 
never was; and, if I pretended to be so, was a hypocrite.&nbsp; 
Some things, as wealth, rank, respectability, I don&rsquo;t care 
a straw about; but no one can resent the toothache more, nor 
fifty other little ills beside that flesh is heir to.&nbsp; But 
let us leave all this.</p>
<p>I am come to London; but I do not go to Operas or Plays: and 
have scarce time (and, it must be said, scarce inclination) to 
hunt up many friends.&nbsp; Dear old Alfred is out of town; 
Spedding is my sheet-anchor, the truly wise and fine fellow: I am
going to his rooms this very evening: and there I believe 
Thackeray, Venables, etc., are to be.&nbsp; I hope not a large 
assembly: for I get shyer and shyer even of those I knew.&nbsp; 
Thackeray is in such a great world that I am afraid of him; he 
gets tired of me: and we are content to regard each other at a 
distance.&nbsp; You, <!-- page 258--><a name="page258"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 258</span>Alfred, Spedding, and Allen, are the
only men I ever care to see again.&nbsp; If ever I leave this 
country I will go and see you at Florence or elsewhere; but my 
plans are at present unsettled.&nbsp; I have refused to be 
Godfather to all who have ever asked me; but I declare it will 
give me sincere pleasure to officiate for your Child.&nbsp; I got
your photograph at last: it is a beastly thing: not a bit like: 
why did you not send your Poems, which are like you; and reflect 
your dear old face well?&nbsp; As you know I admire your poems, 
the only poems by a living writer I do admire, except 
Alfred&rsquo;s, you should not hesitate.&nbsp; I can have no 
doubt whatever they ought to be published in England: I believe 
Moxon would publish them: and I believe you would make some money
by them.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t send them to Alfred to revise or 
select: only for this reason, that you would both of you be a 
little annoyed by gossip about how much share each of you had in 
them.&nbsp; Your poems can want no other hand than your own to 
meddle with them, except in respect of the choice of them to make
a volume which would please generally: a little of the vulgar 
faculty of popular tact is all that needs to be added to you, as 
I think.&nbsp; You will know I do not say this presumptuously: 
since I think the power of writing one fine line transcends all 
the &lsquo;Able-Editor&rsquo; ability in the ably-edited 
Universe.</p>
<p>Do you see Carlyle&rsquo;s &lsquo;Latter Day 
Pamphlets&rsquo;?&nbsp; They make the world laugh, and his 
friends rather sorry for him.&nbsp; But that is because people 
will still <!-- page 259--><a name="page259"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 259</span>look for practical measures from 
him: one must be content with him as a great satirist who can 
make us feel when we are wrong though he cannot set us 
right.&nbsp; There is a bottom of truth in Carlyle&rsquo;s 
wildest rhapsodies.&nbsp; I have no news to tell you of books or 
music, for I scarce see or hear any.&nbsp; And moreover I must be
up, and leave the mahogany coffee-room table on which I write so 
badly: and be off to Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn.&nbsp; God bless you, my
dear fellow.&nbsp; I ask a man of business here in the room about
Grimsby: he says, &lsquo;Well, all these railways are 
troublesome; but the Grimsby one is one of the best: railway 
property must look up a little: and so will Grimsby.&rsquo;</p>

Friday [4 <i>Oct</i>. 1850].</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Donne</span>,</p>
<p>I have been some while intending to send you a few lines, to 
report my continued existence, to thank you for the Papers, which
I and my dear old Crabbe read and mark, and to tell you I was 
much pleased with Laurence&rsquo;s sketch of you, which he 
exhibited to me in a transitory way some weeks ago.&nbsp; Has he 
been to Bury again?&nbsp; To Sir H. Bunbury&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>I am packing up my mind by degrees to move away from here on a
round of visits: and will give you a look at Bury if you like 
it.&nbsp; I am really frightened that it is a whole year since I 
have seen <!-- page 260--><a name="page260"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 260</span>you: and we but two hours 
asunder!&nbsp; I know it is not want of will on my part: though 
you may wonder what other want detains me; but you will believe 
me when I say it is not want of will.&nbsp; You are too busy to 
come here: where indeed is nothing to come for.&nbsp; I wished 
for Charles last Monday: for people came to shoot the three brace
of pheasants inhabiting these woods: had I remembered the first 
of October, I would have let him know.&nbsp; Otherwise, I am 
afraid to invite the young, whom I cannot entertain.</p>
<p>H. Groome came over and dined with me on Wednesday: and Crabbe
came to meet him; but the latter had no hearty smoker to keep him
in countenance, and was not quite comfortable.&nbsp; H. Groome 
improves: his poetical and etymological ambitions begin to pale 
away before years that bring the philosophic mind, and before a 
rising family.</p>
<p>I liked your Articles on Pepys much.&nbsp; How go on the 
Norfolk worthies?&nbsp; I see by your review that you are now 
ripe to write them at your ease: which means (in a work of that 
kind) successfully.</p>

<p>If you knew how glad I am to hear from you, you would write to
me oftener.&nbsp; You see I make a quick return whenever I get an
epistle from you.&nbsp; I should indeed have begun to indite 
before, but I had not a <!-- page 261--><a 
name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>scrap of 
serviceable paper in the house: and I am only this minute 
returned from a wet walk to Woodbridge bringing home the sheet on
which I am now writing, along with the rest of a half-quire, 
which may be filled to you, if we both live.&nbsp; I now count 
the number of sheets: there are nine.&nbsp; I do not think we 
average more than three letters a year each.&nbsp; Shall both of 
us, or either, live three years more, beginning with the year 
that opens to-morrow?&nbsp; I somehow believe <i>not</i>: which I
say not as a doleful thing (indeed you may look at it as a very 
ludicrous one).&nbsp; Well, we shall see.&nbsp; I am all for the 
short and merry life.&nbsp; Last night I began the sixth Book of 
Lucretius in bed.&nbsp; You laugh grimly again?&nbsp; I have not 
looked into it for more than a year, and I took it up by mistake 
for one of Swift&rsquo;s dirty volumes; and, having got into bed 
with it, did not care to get out to change it.</p>
<p>The delightful lady . . . is going to leave this neighbourhood
and carry her young Husband <a name="citation261"></a><a 
href="#footnote261" class="citation">[261]</a> to Oxford, there 
to get him some Oriental Professorship one day.&nbsp; He is a 
delightful fellow, and, <i>I</i> say, will, if he live, be the 
best Scholar in England.&nbsp; Not that I think Oxford will be so
helpful to his studies as his counting house at Ipswich 
was.&nbsp; However, being married he cannot at all events become 
Fellow, and, as so many do, dissolve all the promise of 
Scholarship in Sloth, Gluttony, and sham Dignity.&nbsp; I shall 
miss them both more than I can say, and must take to <!-- page 
262--><a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
262</span>Lucretius! to comfort me.&nbsp; I have entirely given 
up the <i>Genteel</i> Society here about; and scarce ever go 
anywhere but to the neighbouring Parson, <a 
name="citation262a"></a><a href="#footnote262a" 
class="citation">[262a]</a> with whom I discuss Paley&rsquo;s 
Theology, and the Gorham Question.&nbsp; I am going to him 
to-night, by the help of a Lantern, in order to light out the Old
Year with a Cigar.&nbsp; For he is a great Smoker, and a very 
fine fellow in all ways.</p>
<p>I have not seen any one you know since I last wrote; nor heard
from any one: except dear old Spedding, who really came down and 
spent two days with us, me and that Scholar and his Wife in their
Village, <a name="citation262b"></a><a href="#footnote262b" 
class="citation">[262b]</a> in their delightful little house, in 
their pleasant fields by the River side.&nbsp; Old Spedding was 
delicious there; always leaving a mark, I say, in all places one 
has been at with him, a sort of Platonic perfume.&nbsp; For has 
he not all the beauty of the Platonic Socrates, with some 
personal Beauty to boot?&nbsp; He explained to us one day about 
the laws of reflection in water: and I said then one never could 
look at the willow whose branches furnished the text without 
thinking of him.&nbsp; How beastly this reads!&nbsp; As if he 
gave us a lecture!&nbsp; But you know the man, how quietly it all
came out; only because I petulantly denied his plain 
assertion.&nbsp; For I really often cross him only to draw him 
out; and vain as I may be, he is one of those that I am well 
content to make shine at my own expense.</p>
<p><!-- page 263--><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>Don&rsquo;t suppose that this or any other ideal day 
with him effaces my days with you.&nbsp; Indeed, my dear 
Frederic, you also mark many times and many places in which I 
have been with you.&nbsp; Gravesend and its 
&alpha;&nu;&eta;&rho;&iota;&theta;&mu;&omicron;&iota; shrimps 
cannot be forgotten.&nbsp; You say I shall never go to see you at
Florence.&nbsp; I have said to you before and I now repeat it, 
that if ever I go abroad it shall be to see you and my 
Godchild.&nbsp; I really cannot say if I should not have gone 
this winter (as I hinted in my last) in case you had answered my 
letter.&nbsp; But I really did not know if you had not left 
Florence; and a fortnight ago I thought to myself I would write 
to Horatio at Cheltenham and ask him for news of you.&nbsp; As to
Alfred, I have heard of his marriage, etc., from Spedding, who 
also saw and was much pleased with her indeed.&nbsp; But you know
Alfred himself never writes, nor indeed cares a halfpenny about 
one, though he is very well satisfied to see one when one falls 
in his way.&nbsp; You will think I have a spite against him for 
some neglect, when I say this, and say besides that I cannot care
for his In Memoriam.&nbsp; Not so, if I know myself: I always 
thought the same of him, and was just as well satisfied with it 
as now.&nbsp; His poem I never did greatly affect: nor can I 
learn to do so: it is full of finest things, but it is 
monotonous, and has that air of being evolved by a Poetical 
Machine of the highest order.&nbsp; So it seems to be with him 
now, at least to me, the Impetus, the Lyrical &oelig;strus, is 
gone. . . It is the cursed inactivity <!-- page 264--><a 
name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span> (very 
pleasant to me who am no Hero) of this 19th century which has 
spoiled Alfred, I mean spoiled him for the great work he ought 
now to be entering upon; the lovely and noble things he has done 
must remain.&nbsp; It is dangerous work this prophesying about 
great Men. . . .&nbsp; I beg you very much to send me your poems,
the very first opportunity; as I want them very much.&nbsp; 
Nobody doubts that you ought to make a volume for Moxon.&nbsp; 
Send your poems to Spedding to advise on.&nbsp; No doubt Alfred 
would be best adviser of all: but then people would be stupid, 
and say that he had done all that was good in the 
Book&mdash;(wait till I take my tea, which has been lying on the 
table these ten minutes)&mdash;Now, animated by some very 
inferior Souchong from the village shop, I continue my letter, 
having reflected during my repast that I have seen two College 
men you remember since I last wrote, Thompson and Merivale.&nbsp;
The former is just recovering of the water cure, looking blue: 
the latter, Merivale, is just recovering 
from&mdash;Marriage!&mdash;which he undertook this Midsummer, 
with a light-haired daughter of George Frere&rsquo;s.&nbsp; 
Merivale lives just on the borders of Suffolk: and a week before 
his marriage he invited me to meet F. Pollock and his wife at the
Rectory.&nbsp; There we spent two easy days, and I heard no more 
of Merivale till three weeks ago when he asked me to meet 
Thompson just before Christmas. . . .&nbsp; Have you seen 
Merivale&rsquo;s History of Rome, beginning with the 
Empire?&nbsp; Two portly volumes are out, and are <!-- page 
265--><a name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
265</span>approved of by Scholars, I believe.&nbsp; I have not 
read them, not having money to buy, nor any friend to lend.</p>
<p>I hear little music but what I make myself, or help to make 
with my Parson&rsquo;s son and daughter.&nbsp; We, with not a 
voice among us, go through Handel&rsquo;s Coronation 
Anthems!&nbsp; Laughable it may seem; yet it is not quite so; the
things are so well-defined, simple, and grand, that the faintest 
outline of them tells; my admiration of the old Giant grows and 
grows: his is the Music for a Great, Active, People.&nbsp; 
Sometimes too, I go over to a place elegantly called 
<i>Bungay</i>, where a Printer <a name="citation265"></a><a 
href="#footnote265" class="citation">[265]</a> lives who drills 
the young folks of a manufactory there to sing in Chorus once a 
week. . . .&nbsp; They sing some of the English Madrigals, some 
of Purcell, and some of Handel, in a way to satisfy me, who 
don&rsquo;t want perfection, and who believe that the 
<i>grandest</i> things do not depend on delicate finish.&nbsp; If
you were here now, we would go over and hear the Harmonious 
Blacksmith sung in Chorus, with words, of course.&nbsp; It almost
made me cry when I heard the divine Air rolled into vocal harmony
from the four corners of a large Hall.&nbsp; One can scarce 
comprehend the Beauty of the English Madrigals till one hears 
them done (though coarsely) in this way and on a large scale: the
play of the parts as they alternate from the different quarters 
of the room.</p>
<p>I have taken another half sheet to finish my letter upon: so 
as my calculation of how far this half-quire <!-- page 266--><a 
name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>is to 
spread over Time is defeated.&nbsp; Let us write oftener, and 
longer, and we shall not tempt the Fates by inchoating too long a
hope of letter-paper.&nbsp; I have written enough for to-night: I
am now going to sit down and play one of Handel&rsquo;s Overtures
as well as I can&mdash;Semele, perhaps, a very grand 
one&mdash;then, lighting my lantern, trudge through the mud to 
Parson Crabbe&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Before I take my pen again to finish
this letter the New Year will have dawned&mdash;on some of 
us.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thou fool! this night thy soul may be required 
of thee!&rsquo;&nbsp; Very well: while it is in this Body I will 
wish my dear old F. T. a happy New Year.&nbsp; And now to drum 
out the Old with Handel.&nbsp; Good Night.</p>
<p>New Year&rsquo;s Day, 1851.&nbsp; A happy new Year to 
you!&nbsp; I sat up with my Parson till the Old Year was past, 
drinking punch and smoking cigars, for which I endure some 
headache this morning.&nbsp; Not that we took much; but a very 
little punch disagrees with me.&nbsp; Only I would not disappoint
my old friend&rsquo;s convivial expectations.&nbsp; He is one of 
those happy men who has the boy&rsquo;s heart throbbing and 
trembling under the snows of sixty-five.</p>

away as any road, or railroad, brings me within sight of the

going.&nbsp; But they are quite happy at Oxford.</p>
<p>I felt a sort of horror when I read in your letter you had 
ordered the Book <a name="citation267b"></a><a

for fear some one might guess.&nbsp; But if <i>your</i> folks 
don&rsquo;t guess, no one else will.&nbsp; I have heard no more 
of it since I wrote to you last, except that its sale does not 
stand still.&nbsp; Pickering&rsquo;s foreman blundered in the 
Advertisements; quoting an extract about the use of the Book, 
when he should have quoted about its amusement, which is what the
world is attracted by.&nbsp; But I left it to him.&nbsp; As it 
would be a real horror to me to be known as the writer, I do not 
think I can have much personal ambition in its success; but I 
should <!-- page 268--><a name="page268"></a><span

what little benefit it may do. . . .</p>
<p>I have seen scarce anybody here: Thackeray only once; neither 
Tennyson nor Carlyle.&nbsp; Donne came up for a day to see as to 
the morality of the &lsquo;Prodigal Son&rsquo; <a 
name="citation268"></a><a href="#footnote268" 
class="citation">[268]</a> at Drury Lane, which the Bishop of 
London complained of.&nbsp; Donne is deputy Licenser for Jack

gaudy.</p>

<p>I am ashamed you should have the trouble of asking me to 
Merton so often, and so in vain.&nbsp; I might give you a 
specious reason for not going now . . . but I will honestly 
confess I believe I should not have accompanied your Father in 
his Voyage to your house, had the sky been quite clear of 
engagement.&nbsp; Why, I cannot exactly say: my soul is not 
packed up for Merton yet, though one day it will be; and I have 
no such idea of the preciousness of my company as to have any 
hesitation in letting my friends wait any length of time before I
go to occupy their easy chairs.&nbsp; The day will come, if we 
live.&nbsp; I have had a very strong invitation to Cambridge this
week; to live with my old friends the Skrines in Sidney 
College.&nbsp; But why should we meet to see <!-- page 269--><a

<p>Why do you never write to me?&nbsp; I am sure I wrote last: I 
constantly am thinking of you, and constantly wishing to see 
you.&nbsp; Perhaps you are in England at this very hour, and do 
not let me know of it.&nbsp; <i>When</i> I wrote to you last I 
cannot remember; whether in Winter or Spring.&nbsp; I was in 
London during January and February last, but have been vegetating
down here ever since.&nbsp; Have not been up even to see the 
Great Exh.&mdash;one is tired of writing, and seeing written, the
word.&nbsp; All the world, as you know, goes in droves: you may 
be lounging in it this very hour, though I don&rsquo;t mean to 
say you are one of a drove.&nbsp; It is because there are so few 
F. Tennysons in the world that I do not like to be wholly out of 
hearing of the one I know. . . .&nbsp; My own affairs do not 
improve, and I have seen more and more of the pitiful in humanity
. . . but luckily my wants decrease.&nbsp; I am quite content 
never to buy a picture or a Book; almost content not to see 
them.&nbsp; One could soon relapse into Barbarism.&nbsp; I do 
indeed <!-- page 270--><a name="page270"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 270</span>take a survey of old Handel&rsquo;s 
Choruses now and then; and am just now looking with great delight
into Purcell&rsquo;s King Arthur, real noble <i>English</i> 
music, much of it; and assuredly the prototype of much of 
Handel.&nbsp; It is said Handel would not admire Purcell; but I 
am sure he adapted himself to English ears and sympathies by 
means of taking up Purcell&rsquo;s vein.&nbsp; I wish you were 
here to consider this with me; but you would grunt dissent, and 
smile bitterly at my theories.&nbsp; I am trying to teach the 
bumpkins of the united parishes of Boulge and Debach to sing a 
second to such melodies as the women sing by way of Hymns in our 
Church: and I have invented (as I think) a most simple and easy 
way of teaching them the little they need to learn.&nbsp; How 
would you like to see me, with a bit of chalk in my hand, before 
a black board, scoring up semibreves on a staff for half a dozen 
Rustics to vocalize?&nbsp; Laugh at me in Imagination. . . .</p>
<p>Almost the only man I hear from is dear old Spedding, who has 
lost his Father, and is now, I suppose, a rich man.&nbsp; This 
makes no apparent change in his way of life: he has only hired an
additional Attic in Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields, so as to be able 
to bed a friend upon occasion.&nbsp; I may have to fill it ere 
long.&nbsp; Merivale (you know, surely) is married, and has a son
I hear.&nbsp; He lives some twenty miles from here. . . .</p>
<p>Now, my dear Frederic, this is a sadly dull letter.&nbsp; I 
could have made it duller and sadder by telling you <!-- page 
271--><a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
271</span>other things.&nbsp; But, instead of this, let me hear 
from you a good account of yourself and your family, and 
especially of my little Godson.&nbsp; Remember, I have a right to
hear about him.&nbsp; Ever yours, dear old Grimsby,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear old Frederic</span>,</p>
<p>I have long been thinking I would answer a long and kind 
letter I had from you some weeks ago, in which you condoled with 
me about my finances, and offered me your house as a Refuge for 
the Destitute.&nbsp; I can never wonder at generosity in you: but
I am sorry I should have seemed to complain so much as to provoke
so much pity from you.&nbsp; I am not worse off than I have been 
these last three years; and so much better off than thousands who
deserve more that I should deserve to be kicked if I whined over 
my decayed fortunes.&nbsp; If I go to Italy, it will be to see 
Florence and Fred. Tennyson: I do not despair of going one day: I
believe my desire is gathering, and my indolence warming up with 
the exhilarating increase of Railroads.</p>
<p>But for the present here I am, at 19 Charlotte Street, Fitzroy
Square, come up to have a fresh squabble with Lawyers, and to see
to an old College friend who is gone mad, and threatens to drive 
his wife mad too, I think.&nbsp; Here are troubles, if you <!-- 
page 272--><a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
272</span>like: I mean, these poor people&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Well, I 
have not had much time except to post about in Omnibi between 
Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn and Bayswater: but I have seen Alfred once; 
Carlyle once; Thackeray twice; and Spedding many times.&nbsp; I 
did not see Mrs. A.: but am to go and dine there one day before I
leave.&nbsp; Carlyle has been undergoing the Water System at 
Malvern, and says it has done him a very little good.&nbsp; He 
would be quite well, he says, if he threw his Books away, and 
walked about the mountains: but that would be &lsquo;propter 
vitam, etc.&rsquo;&nbsp; Nature made him a Writer: so he must 
wear himself out writing Lives of Sterling, etc., for the Benefit
of the World.&nbsp; Thackeray says he is getting tired of being 
witty, and of the great world: he is now gone to deliver his 
Lectures <a name="citation272"></a><a href="#footnote272" 
class="citation">[272]</a> at Edinburgh: having already given 
them at Oxford and Cambridge.&nbsp; Alfred, I thought looking 
pretty well.&nbsp; Spedding is immutably wise, good, and 
delightful: not so immutably well in Body, I think: though he 
does not complain.&nbsp; But I will deal in no more vaticinations
of Evil.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t think what was the oracle in my 
Letters you allude to, I mean about the three years&rsquo; 
duration of our lives.&nbsp; I have long felt about England as 
you do, and even made up my mind to it, so as to sit 
comparatively, if ignobly, easy on that score.&nbsp; Sometimes I 
envy those who are so old that the curtain will probably fall on 
them before it does on their Country.&nbsp; If one could save the
Race, what a Cause it would be! not for <!-- page 273--><a 
name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>one&rsquo;s
own glory as a member of it, nor even for its glory as a Nation: 
but because it is the only spot in Europe where Freedom keeps her
place.&nbsp; Had I Alfred&rsquo;s voice, I would not have mumbled
for years over In Memoriam and the Princess, but sung such 
strains as would have revived the 
&Mu;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;&theta;&omega;&nu;&omicron;&mu;&alpha;&chi;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;
&alpha;&nu;&delta;&rho;&alpha;&sigmaf; to guard the territory 
they had won.&nbsp; What can &lsquo;In Memoriam&rsquo; do but 
make us all sentimental? . . .</p>
<p>My dear Frederic, I hope to see you one day: I really do look 
forward one day to go and see you in Italy, as well as to see you
here in England.&nbsp; I know no one whom it would give me more 
pleasure to think of as one who might perhaps be near me as we 
both go down the hill together, whether in Italy or 
England.&nbsp; You, Spedding, Thackeray, and only one or two 
more.&nbsp; The rest have come like shadows and so departed.</p>

<p>. . . I rejoice in your telling me what you think; or I should
rejoice if these books were of importance enough to require 
honest advice.&nbsp; I think you may be very right about the 
length of the Preface; <a name="citation273"></a><a 
href="#footnote273" class="citation">[273]</a> that I do not 
think you right about the reasoning of it you may suppose by my 
ever printing it.&nbsp; It is to show <!-- page 274--><a 
name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span><i>why</i> 
Books of that kind are dull: what sort of writers ought to be 
quoted, etc.; proverbial writers: and what constitutes 
proverbiality, etc.&nbsp; Well, enough of it all: I am glad you 
like it on the whole.&nbsp; As to Euphranor I do wish him not to 
die yet: and am gratified you think him worthy to survive a

<p>I and Drew sat up at your Father&rsquo;s till 3 (a.m.) last

<p>I am really going next week from home, towards that famous 
expedition to Shropshire <a name="citation274"></a><a

perform one day.&nbsp; I write after walking to Woodbridge: and 
hear that Mr. Cana has called in my absence to announce that 
&lsquo;the Hall&rsquo; is let; to a Mr. Cobbold, from Saxmundham,
I think, who has a farm at Sutton.&nbsp; I met Tom (<i>young</i> 
Tom) Churchyard in Woodbridge, who tells me he is going to 
America on Monday!&nbsp; He makes less fuss about it than I do 
about going to Shropshire.</p>

<p>In spite of my anti-London prejudices, I find this Limb of 
London (for such it is) very beautiful: the Thames with its Swans
upon it, and its wooded sides garnished with the Villas of Poets,
Wits, and Courtiers, of a Time which (I am sorry to say) has more
charms to me than the Middle Ages, or the Heroic.</p>
<p>I have seen scarce any of the living London Wits; Spedding and
Donne most: Thackeray but twice for a few minutes.&nbsp; He 
finished his Novel <a name="citation275"></a><a

is gone, I believe, to the Continent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Frederic</span>,</p>
<p>It gave me, as always, the greatest pleasure to hear from 
you.&nbsp; Your letter found me at my Mother&rsquo;s house, at 
Ham, close to Richmond; a really lovely place, and neighbourhood,
though I say it who am all prejudiced against London and 
&lsquo;all the purtenances thereof.&rsquo;&nbsp; But the copious 
woods, green meadows, the Thames and its swans gliding between, 
and so many villas and cheerful houses and terraced gardens with 
all their associations of Wits and Courtiers on either <!-- page 
276--><a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
276</span>side, all this is very delightful.&nbsp; I am not 
heroic enough for Castles, Battlefields, etc.&nbsp; Strawberry 
Hill for me!&nbsp; I looked all over it: you know all the 
pictures, jewels, curiosities, were sold some ten years ago; only
bare walls remain: the walls indeed here and there stuck with 
Gothic woodwork, and the ceilings with Gothic gilding, sometimes 
painted Gothic to imitate woodwork; much of it therefore in less 
good taste: all a Toy, but yet the Toy of a very clever 
man.&nbsp; The rain is coming through the Roofs, and gradually 
disengaging the confectionary Battlements and Cornices.&nbsp; Do 
you like Walpole? did you ever read him?&nbsp; Then close by is 
Hampton Court: with its stately gardens, and fine portraits 
inside; all very much to my liking.&nbsp; I am quite sure gardens
should be formal, and unlike general Nature.&nbsp; I much prefer 
the old French and Dutch gardens to what are called the 
English.</p>
<p>I saw scarce any of our friends during the three weeks I 
passed at Ham.&nbsp; Though I had to run to London several times,
I generally ran back as fast as I could; much preferring the 
fresh air and the fields to the smoke and &lsquo;the wilderness 
of monkeys&rsquo; in London.&nbsp; Thackeray I saw for ten 
minutes: he was just in the agony of finishing a Novel: which has
arisen out of the Reading necessary for his Lectures, and relates
to those Times&mdash;of Queen Anne, I mean.&nbsp; He will get 
&pound;1000 for his Novel.&nbsp; He was wanting to finish it, and
rush off to the Continent, I think, to shake off the fumes of 
it.&nbsp; Old Spedding, that aged <!-- page 277--><a 
name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>and most 
subtle Serpent, was in his old haunt in Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn 
Fields, up to any mischief.&nbsp; It was supposed that Alfred was
somewhere near Malvern: Carlyle I did not go to see, for I really
have nothing to tell him, and I have got tired of hearing him 
growl: though I do not cease to admire him as much as ever.&nbsp;
I also went once to the pit of the Covent Garden Italian Opera, 
to hear Meyerbeer&rsquo;s Huguenots, of which I had only heard 
bits on the Pianoforte.&nbsp; But the first Act was so noisy, and
ugly, that I came away, unable to wait for the better part, that,
I am told, follows.&nbsp; Meyerbeer is a man of Genius: and works
up <i>dramatic</i> Music: but he has scarce any melody, and is 
rather grotesque and noisy than really powerful.&nbsp; I think 
this is the fault of modern music; people cannot believe that 
Mozart is <i>powerful</i> because he is so Beautiful: in the same
way as it requires a very practised eye (more than I possess) to 
recognize the consummate power predominating in the tranquil 
Beauty of Greek Sculpture.&nbsp; I think Beethoven is rather 
spasmodically, than sustainedly, grand.</p>
<p>Well, I must take to my third side after all, which I meant to
have spared you, partly because of this transparent paper, and my
more than usually bad writing.&nbsp; I came down here four days 
ago: and have this morning sketched for you the enclosed, the 
common that lies before my Bedroom window, as I pulled up my 
blind, and opened my shutter upon it, early this morning.&nbsp; I
never draw now, never drew <!-- page 278--><a 
name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>well; but 
this may serve to give a hint of poor old dewy England to you who
are, I suppose, beginning to be dried up in the South.&nbsp; W. 
Browne, my host, tells me that your Grimsby Rail is looking up 
greatly, and certainly will pay well, sooner or later: which I 
devoutly hope it may.</p>
<p>I do not think I told you my Father was dead; like poor old 
Sedley in Thackeray&rsquo;s Vanity Fair, all his Coal schemes at 
an end.&nbsp; He died in March, after an illness of three weeks, 
saying &lsquo;that engine works well&rsquo; (meaning one of his 
Colliery steam engines) as he lay in the stupor of Death.&nbsp; I
was in Shropshire at the time, with my old friend Allen; but I 
went home to Suffolk just to help to lay him in the Grave.</p>
<p>Pray do send me your Poems, one and all: I should like very 
much to talk them over with you, however much you might resent 
me, who am no Poet, presuming to advise you who as certainly are 
one.&nbsp; That you ought to publish some of these Poems (as I 
think, somewhat condensed, or, at least, curtailed) I am more and
more sure, having seen the very great pleasure, and deep 
interest, some of them have caused when read to persons of very 
different talents and tastes.</p>
<p>And now, my dear Frederic, farewell for the present.&nbsp; 
Remember, you cannot write to me too often, as far as I am 
concerned.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t write Politics&mdash;I agree with you 
beforehand.</p>

<p>It is very good of you to write to me, so much as you have to 
do.&nbsp; I am much obliged to you also for taking the trouble to
go and see my Mother.&nbsp; You may rely on it she feels as 
pleased with your company as she says she is: I do not know any 
one who has the power of being so agreeable to her as 
yourself.</p>
<p>And dear old Thackeray is really going to America!&nbsp; I 
must fire him a letter of farewell.</p>
<p>The Cowells are at Ipswich, and I get over to see them, 
etc.&nbsp; They talk of coming here too.&nbsp; I have begun again
to read Calderon with Cowell: the Magico we have just read, a 
very grand thing.&nbsp; I suppose Calderon was over-praised some 
twenty years ago: for the last twenty it has been the fashion to 
underpraise him, I am sure.&nbsp; His Drama may not be the finest
in the world: one sees how often too he wrote in the fashion of 
his time and country: but he is a wonderful fellow: one of the 
Great Men of the world.</p>

<p>In October 1852 Thackeray sailed for America and before 
leaving wrote to FitzGerald the letter which he copied for 
Archdeacon Allen.&nbsp; I shall I trust be pardoned for thinking 
that others will be the better for reading the words of 
&lsquo;noble kindness&rsquo; in which Thackeray took leave of his

Farewell and God Bless you.&nbsp; If anything happens to me, you 
by these presents must get ready the Book of Ballads which you 
like, and which I had not time to prepare before embarking on 
this voyage.&nbsp; And I should like my daughters to remember 
that you are the best and oldest friend their Father ever had, 
and that you would act as such: as my literary executor and so 
forth.&nbsp; My Books would yield a something as copyrights: and,
should anything occur, I have commissioned friends in good place 
to get a Pension for my poor little wife. . . .&nbsp; Does not 
this sound gloomily?&nbsp; Well: who knows what Fate is in store:
and I feel not at all downcast, but very grave and solemn just at
the brink of a great voyage.</p>
<p><!-- page 281--><a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

you shall yawn over when you are inclined.&nbsp; But the great 
comfort I have in thinking about my dear old boy is that 
recollection of our youth when we loved each other as I do now

<p>That the feelings here expressed were fully reciprocated by 
FitzGerald is clear from the following words of a letter written 
by him to Thackeray to tell him of a provision he had made in his
will.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;You see you can owe me no thanks for giving
what I can no longer use &ldquo;when I go down to the pit,&rdquo;
and it would be some satisfaction to me, and some diminution of 
the shame I felt on reading your letter, if &ldquo;after many 
days&rdquo; your generous and constant friendship bore some sort 
of fruit, if not to yourself to those you are naturally anxious 
about.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have not been able to ascertain the exact time at which 
FitzGerald began his Spanish studies; but it must have been long 
before this, for in 1853 the first-fruits of them appeared in the
&lsquo;Six Dramas from <!-- page 282--><a 
name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>Calderon 
freely translated by Edward FitzGerald,&rsquo; the only book to 
which he ever put his name.&nbsp; It was probably in 1853 that he
took up Persian, in which, as in Spanish, his friend Cowell was 
his guide.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear George</span>,</p>
<p>Your account of the Doctor&rsquo;s warnings to your Cousin in 
your first note delighted me greatly: as it did your Father to 
whom I read it last night.&nbsp; For, on coming home from 
Aldbro&rsquo; (where I had been for a day) I found to my great 
surprise your Father smoking in my room, with a bottle of Port 
(which he had brought with him!).&nbsp; The mystery was then 
solved; that, after his own dinner, Mr. --- was announced, and 
your Father dreading lest he should stay all the Evening declared
he had most important business, first at Woodbridge, then, on 
second thoughts, with me; and so decamped.</p>
<p>Now as to your second letter which I found also on my return: 
I am very glad you like the plays <a name="citation282"></a><a 
href="#footnote282" class="citation">[282]</a> and am encouraged 
to hope that other persons who are not biassed by pedantic 
prejudices or spites might like them too.&nbsp; But I fully 
expect that (as I told you, I think) the London press, etc., will
either sink them, or condemn them as on too <!-- page 283--><a

principle: and all the more if they have not read the 
originals.&nbsp; For these are safe courses to adopt.&nbsp; All 
this while I am assuming the plays are well done in their way, 
which of course I do.&nbsp; On the other hand, they really may 
not be as well done as I think; on their own principle: and that 
would really be a fair ground of condemnation.</p>

Calderon to be on the whole well done and entertaining, I began

<p>Your account of Sherborne rouses all the Dowager within 
me.&nbsp; I shall have to leave this cottage, I believe, and have
not yet found a place sufficiently dull to migrate to.&nbsp;

the Assizes at Ipswich: where I shall see little Voltaire Jervis,

<p>I enclose you a scrap from &lsquo;The Leader&rsquo; as you 
like to see criticisms on my Calderon.&nbsp; I suppose your 
sisters will send you the Athen&aelig;um in which you will see a 
more determined spit at me.&nbsp; I foresaw (as I think I told 
you) how likely this was to be the case: and so am not 
surprized.&nbsp; One must take these chances if one will play at 
so doubtful a game.&nbsp; I believe those who read the Book, 
without troubling themselves about whether it is a free 
Translation or not, like it: but Critics must be supposed to know
all, and it is safe to condemn.&nbsp; On the other hand, the 
Translation may not be good on any ground: and then the Critics 
are all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Frederic</span>,</p>
<p>I am too late to wish you a Happy Christmas; so must wish you 
a happy New Year.&nbsp; Write to me here, and tell me (in however
few words) how you prospered in your journey to Italy: how you 
all are there: and how your Book progresses.&nbsp; I saw Harvest 
Home advertised in Fraser: and I have heard from Mrs. Alfred it 
is so admired that Parker is to print two thousand copies of the 
Volume.&nbsp; I am glad of this: and I think, little ambitious or
vain as you really are, you will insensibly be pleased at gaining
your proper Station in public Celebrity.&nbsp; Had I not known 
what an invidious office it is to meddle with such Poems, and how
assuredly people would <!-- page 286--><a 
name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 286</span>have said 
that one had helped to clip away the Best Poems, and the best 
part of them, I should have liked to advise you in the selection:
a matter in which I feel confidence.&nbsp; But you would not have
agreed with me any more than others: though on different grounds:
and so in all ways it was, and is, and will be, best to say 
nothing more on the subject.&nbsp; I am very sure that, of 
whatever your Volume is composed, you will make public almost the
only Volume of Verse, except Alfred&rsquo;s, worthy of the 
name.</p>
<p>I hear from Mrs. Alfred they are got to their new abode in the
Isle of Wight.&nbsp; I have been into Norfolk: and am now come to
spend Christmas in this place, where, as you have been here, you 
can fancy me.&nbsp; Old Crabbe is as brave and hearty as ever: 
drawing designs of Churches: and we are all now reading 
Moore&rsquo;s Memoirs with considerable entertainment: I cannot 
say the result of it in one&rsquo;s mind is to prove Moore a 
Great Man: though it certainly does not leave him altogether 
&lsquo;The Poor Creature&rsquo; that Mr. Allingham reduced him 
to.&nbsp; I also amuse myself with poking out some Persian which 
E. Cowell would inaugurate me with: I go on with it because it is
a point in common with him, and enables us to study a little 
together.&nbsp; He and his wife are at Oxford: and his Pracrit 
Grammar is to be out in a few days.</p>
<p>I have settled upon no new Abode: but have packed up all my 
few goods in a neighbouring Farm <!-- page 287--><a 
name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>House <a 
name="citation287a"></a><a href="#footnote287a" 
class="citation">[287a]</a> (that one near Woodbridge I took you 
to), and will now float about for a year and visit some 
friends.&nbsp; Perhaps I shall get down to the Isle of Wight one 
day: also to Shropshire, to see Allen: to Bath to a Sister.&nbsp;
But you can always direct hither, since old Crabbe is only too 
glad to have some letters to pay for, and forward to me. . . 
.&nbsp; We have one of the old fashioned winters, snow and frost:
not fulfilling the word of those who were quite sure the seasons 
were altered.&nbsp; Farewell, my dear Frederic.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">E. F. G.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Bath</span>, 
<i>May</i> 7/54.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Frederic</span>,</p>
<p>You see to what fashionable places I am reduced in my old 
Age.&nbsp; The truth is however I am come here by way of Visit to
a sister <a name="citation287b"></a><a href="#footnote287b" 
class="citation">[287b]</a> I have scarce seen these six years; 
my visit consisting in this that I live alone in a lodging of my 
own by day, and spend two or three hours with her in the 
Evening.&nbsp; This has been my way of Life for three weeks, and 
will be so for some ten days more: after which I talk of flying 
back to more native counties.&nbsp; I was to have gone on to see 
Alfred in his &lsquo;Island Home&rsquo; from here: but it appears
he goes to London about the same time I quit this place: so I 
must and shall defer my Visit to him.&nbsp; Perhaps I shall catch
a sight of him in London; as also of old Thackeray who, Donne 
<!-- page 288--><a name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
288</span>writes me word, came suddenly on him in Pall Mall the 
other day: while all the while people supposed the Newcomes were 
being indited at Rome or Naples.</p>
<p>If ever you live in England you must live here at Bath.&nbsp; 
It really is a splendid City in a lovely, even a noble, 
Country.&nbsp; Did you ever see it?&nbsp; One beautiful feature 
in the place is the quantity of Garden and Orchard it is all 
through embroidered with.&nbsp; Then the Streets, when you go 
into them, are as handsome and gay as London, gayer and handsomer
because cleaner and in a clearer Atmosphere; and if you want the 
Country you get into it (and a very fine Country) on all sides 
and directly.&nbsp; Then there is such Choice of Houses, Cheap as
well as Dear, of all sizes, with good Markets, Railways, 
etc.&nbsp; I am not sure I shall not come here for part of the 
Winter.&nbsp; It is a place you would like, I am sure: though I 
do not say but you are better in Florence.&nbsp; Then on the top 
of the hill is old Vathek&rsquo;s Tower, which he used to sit and
read in daily, and from which he could see his own Fonthill, 
while it stood.&nbsp; Old Landor quoted to me &lsquo;Nullus in 
orbe locus, etc.,&rsquo; apropos of Bath: he, you may know, has 
lived here for years, and I should think would die here, though 
not yet.&nbsp; He seems so strong that he may rival old Rogers; 
of whom indeed one Newspaper gave what is called an 
&lsquo;Alarming Report of Mr. Rogers&rsquo; Health&rsquo; the 
other day, but another contradicted it directly and indignantly, 
<!-- page 289--><a name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
289</span>and declared the Venerable Poet never was better.&nbsp;
Landor has some hundred and fifty Pictures; each of which he 
thinks the finest specimen of the finest Master, and has a long 
story about, how he got it, when, etc.&nbsp; I dare say some are 
very good: but also some very bad.&nbsp; He appeared to me to 
judge of them as he does of Books and Men; with a most 
uncompromising perversity which the Phrenologists must explain to
us after his Death.</p>
<p>By the bye, about your Book, which of course you wish me to 
say something about.&nbsp; Parker sent me down a copy &lsquo;from
the Author&rsquo; for which I hereby thank you.&nbsp; If you 
believe my word, you already know my Estimation of so much that 
is in it: you have already guessed that I should have made a 
different selection from the great Volume which is now in 
Tatters.&nbsp; As I differ in Taste from the world, however, 
quite as much as from you, I do not know but you have done very 
much better in choosing as you have; the few people I have seen 
are very much pleased with it, the Cowells at Oxford 
delighted.&nbsp; A Bookseller there sold all his Copies the first
day they came down: and even in Bath a Bookseller (and not one of
the Principal) told me a fortnight ago he had sold some twenty 
Copies.&nbsp; I have not been in Town since it came out: and have
now so little correspondence with literati I can&rsquo;t tell you
about them.&nbsp; There was a very unfair Review in the 
Athen&aelig;um; which is the only Literary Paper I see: <!-- page
290--><a name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
290</span>but I am told there are laudatory ones in Examiner and 
Spectator.</p>
<p>I was five weeks at Oxford, visiting the Cowells in just the 
same way that I am visiting my Sister here.&nbsp; I also liked 
Oxford greatly: but not so well I think as Bath: which is so 
large and busy that one is drowned in it as much as in 
London.&nbsp; There are often concerts, etc., for those who like 
them; I only go to a shilling affair that comes off every 
Saturday at what they call the Pump Room.&nbsp; On these 
occasions there is sometimes some Good Music if not excellently 
played.&nbsp; Last Saturday I heard a fine Trio of 
Beethoven.&nbsp; Mendelssohn&rsquo;s things are mostly tiresome 
to me.&nbsp; I have brought my old Handel Book here and recreate 
myself now and then with pounding one of the old Giant&rsquo;s 
Overtures on my sister&rsquo;s Piano, as I used to do on that 
Spinnet at my Cottage.&nbsp; As to Operas, and Exeter Halls, I 
have almost done with them: they give me no pleasure, I scarce 
know why.</p>
<p>I suppose there is no chance of your being over in England 
this year, and perhaps as little Chance of my being in 
Italy.&nbsp; All I can say is, the latter is not impossible, 
which I suppose I may equally say of the former.&nbsp; But pray 
write to me.&nbsp; You can always direct to me at Donne&rsquo;s, 
12 St. James&rsquo; Square, or at Rev. G. Crabbe&rsquo;s, 
Bredfield, Woodbridge.&nbsp; Either way the letter will soon 
reach me.&nbsp; Write soon, Frederic, and let me hear how you and
yours are: and don&rsquo;t wait, as you usually do, for some 
inundation <!-- page 291--><a name="page291"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 291</span>of the Arno to set your pen 
agoing.&nbsp; Write ever so shortly and whatever-about-ly.&nbsp; 
I have no news to tell you of Friends.&nbsp; I saw old Spedding 
in London; only doubly calm after the death of a Niece he dearly 
loved and whose death-bed at Hastings he had just been waiting 
upon.&nbsp; Harry <a name="citation291"></a><a 
href="#footnote291" class="citation">[291]</a> Lushington wrote a
martial Ode on seeing the Guards march over Waterloo Bridge 
towards the East: I did not see it, but it was much admired and 
handed about, I believe.&nbsp; And now my paper is out: and I am 
going through the rain (it is said to rain very much here) to my 
Sister&rsquo;s.&nbsp; So Good Bye, and write to me, as I beg you,
in reply to this long if not very interesting letter.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What cheer?&rsquo;&nbsp; This is what we nautical Men 
shout to one another as we pass in our Ships.&nbsp; The Answer is
generally only an Echo; but you will have to tell me something 
more.&nbsp; I find it rather disgusting to set you an example by 
telling of my Doings; for it is always the same thing over and 
over again.&nbsp; I doubt this will put an End to even Letters at
last: I mean, on my part.&nbsp; You have others beside yourself 
to tell of; you go abroad, too; deliver charges, etc.</p>
<p><!-- page 292--><a name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
292</span>Well, however, I had better say that I have been for 
the last four months going about in my little Ship as in former 
years, and now am about to lay up her, and myself, for the 
Winter.&nbsp; The only Friend I hear from is Donne, who 
volunteers a Letter unprovoked sometimes.&nbsp; Old Spedding 
gives an unwilling Reply about thrice in two years.&nbsp; You 
speak when spoken to; so does Thompson, in general: I shall soon 
ask of him what he has been doing this Summer.</p>
<p>I have been reading in my Boat&mdash;Virgil, Juvenal, and 
Wesley&rsquo;s Journal.&nbsp; Do you know the last? one of the 
most interesting Books, I think, in the Language.&nbsp; It is 
curious to think of his Diary extending over nearly the same time
as Walpole&rsquo;s Letters, which, you know, are a sort of 
Diary.&nbsp; What two different Lives, Pursuits, and 
Topics!&nbsp; The other day I was sitting in a Garden at 
Lowestoft in which Wesley had preached his first Sermon there: 
the Wall he set his Back against yet standing.&nbsp; About 1790 
<a name="citation292a"></a><a href="#footnote292a" 
class="citation">[292a]</a> Crabbe, the Poet, went to hear him; 
he was helped into the Pulpit by two Deacons, and 
quoted&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;By the Women oft I&rsquo;m told,<br />
Poor Anacreon, thou grow&rsquo;st old, etc.&rsquo; <a

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Carlyle</span>,</p>
<p>I should sometimes write to you if I had anything worth 
telling, or worth putting you to the trouble of answering 
me.&nbsp; About twice in a year however I do not mind asking you 
one thing which is easily answered, how you and Mrs. Carlyle 
are?&nbsp; And yet perhaps it is not so easy for you to tell me 
so much about yourself: for your &lsquo;well-being&rsquo; 
comprises a good deal!&nbsp; That you are not carried off by the 
Cholera I take for granted: since else I should have seen in the 
papers some controversy with Doctor Wordsworth as to whether you 
were to be buried in Westminster Abbey, by the side of 
Wilberforce perhaps!&nbsp; Besides, a short note from Thackeray a
few weeks ago told me you had been to see him.&nbsp; I conclude 
also from this that you have not been a summer excursion of any 
distance.</p>
<p>I address from the Rectory (<i>Vicarage</i> it ought to be) of
Crabbe, the &lsquo;<i>Radiator</i>,&rsquo; whose mind is now 
greatly exercised with Dr. Whewell&rsquo;s Plurality of 
Worlds.&nbsp; Crabbe, who is a good deal in the secrets of 
Providence, admires the work beyond measure, but most indignantly
rejects the Doctrine as unworthy of God.&nbsp; I have not read 
the Book, contented to <!-- page 294--><a 
name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 294</span>hear 
Crabbe&rsquo;s commentaries.&nbsp; I have been staying with him 
off and on for two months, and, as I say, give his Address 
because any letter thither directed will find me sooner or later 
in my little wanderings.&nbsp; I am at present staying with a 
Farmer in a very pleasant house near Woodbridge: inhabiting such 
a room as even you, I think, would sleep composedly in; my host a
taciturn, cautious, honest, active man whom I have known all my 
Life.&nbsp; He and his Wife, a capital housewife, and his Son, 
who could carry me on his shoulders to Ipswich, and a Maid 
servant who, as she curtsies of a morning, lets fall the Tea-pot,
etc., constitute the household.&nbsp; Farming greatly prospers; 
farming materials fetching an exorbitant price at the Michaelmas 
Auctions: all in defiance of Sir Fitzroy Kelly who got returned 
for Suffolk on the strength of denouncing Corn Law Repeal as the 
ruin of the Country.&nbsp; He has bought a fine house near 
Ipswich, with great gilded gates before it, and by dint of good 
dinners and soft sawder finally draws the country Gentry to him. 
. . .</p>
<p>Please to look at the September Number of Fraser&rsquo;s 
Magazine where are some prose Translations of Hafiz by Cowell 
which may interest you a little.&nbsp; I think Cowell (as he is 
apt to do) gives Hafiz rather too much credit for a mystical 
wine-cup, and Cupbearer; I mean taking him on the whole.&nbsp; 
The few odes he quotes have certainly a deep and pious feeling: 
such as the Man of Mirth will feel at times; none perhaps more 
strongly.</p>

quoted in Knight&rsquo;s &lsquo;Half Hours, etc.&rsquo;&nbsp; It 
is now twelve years ago, at this very season, I was ransacking 
for you; you promising to come down, and never coming.&nbsp; I 
hope very much you are soon going to give us something: else

<p>In August 1855 Carlyle went to stay with FitzGerald at 
Farlingay, a farm house on the Hasketon road, half a mile from 
Woodbridge.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Bredfield 
Rectory</span>, <span class="smcap">Woodbridge</span>.<br />
<i>August</i> 1, [1855].</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Carlyle</span>,</p>
<p>I came down here yesterday: and saw my Farming Friends to-day,
who are quite ready to do all service for us at any time.&nbsp; 
They live about two miles nearer Woodbridge than this place I 
write from and I am certain they and their place will suit you 
very well.&nbsp; I am going to them any day: indeed am always 
fluctuating between this place and theirs; and you can come down 
to me there, or here, any <!-- page 296--><a 
name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
296</span>day&mdash;(for Crabbe and his Daughter will, they bid 
me say, be very glad if you will come; and I engage you 
shan&rsquo;t be frightened, and that the place shall suit you as 
well as the Farmer&rsquo;s).&nbsp; I say you can come to either 
place any day, and without warning if you like; only in that case
I can&rsquo;t go to meet you at Ipswich.&nbsp; Beds, etc., are 
all ready whether here or at the Farmer&rsquo;s.&nbsp; If you 
like to give me notice, you can say which place you will come to 
first: and I will meet you at any time at Ipswich.</p>
<p>I think if you come you had best come as soon as possible, 
before harvest, and while the Days are long and fine.&nbsp; Why 
not come directly? while all the Coast is so clear?</p>
<p>Now as to your mode of going.&nbsp; There are Rail Trains to 
Ipswich from Shoreditch, at 7 a.m. 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. all of 
which come to Ipswich in time for Coaches which carry you to 
Woodbridge; where, if you arrive unawares, any one will show you 
the way to Mr. Smith&rsquo;s, of Farlingay Hall, about half a 
mile from Woodbridge; or direct you to Parson Crabbe&rsquo;s, at 
Bredfield, about three miles from Woodbridge.&nbsp; You may take 
my word (will you?) that you will be very welcome at either or 
both of these places; I mean, to the owners as well as 
myself.</p>
<p>Well, then there is a Steamer every Wednesday and Sunday; 
which starts from Blackwall at 9 a.m.; to go by which you must be
at the Blackwall Railroad Station in Fenchurch Street by half 
past eight.&nbsp; This <!-- page 297--><a 
name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 297</span>Steamer 
gets to Ipswich at &frac12; past 5 or 6; probably in time for a 
Woodbridge Coach, but not certainly.&nbsp; It is a very pleasant 
sail.&nbsp; The Rail to Ipswich takes three or two and a half 
hours.</p>
<p>Have I more to say?&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t think of it if I 
have.&nbsp; Only, dear Mrs. Carlyle, please to let me know what 
C. is &lsquo;<i>To Eat&mdash;Drink&mdash;and 
Avoid</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; As I know that his wants are in a small 
compass, it will be as easy to get what he likes as not, if you 
will only say.&nbsp; If you like Sunday Steam, it will be quite 
convenient whether here or at Farlingay.&nbsp; Crabbe only is too
glad if one doesn&rsquo;t go to his church.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span 
class="smcap">Bredfield</span>, <i>Sunday</i>.</p>
<p>Scrap for Scrap!&nbsp; I go to-morrow to stay at Farlingay, 
where you will find me, or I will find you, as proposed in my 
last.&nbsp; Do not let it be a burden on you to come now, then, 
or at all; but, if you come, I think this week will be good in 
weather as in other respects.&nbsp; You will be at most entire 
Liberty; with room, garden, and hours, to yourself, whether at 
Farlingay or here, where you must come for a day or so.&nbsp; 
Pipes are the order of the house at both places; the Radiator 
always lighting up after his 5 o&rsquo;clock dinner, and rather 
despising me for not always doing so.&nbsp; At both places a 
capital sunshiny airy Bedroom without any noise.&nbsp; I wish 
Mrs. C. could come, indeed; but I will not propose this; for <!--
page 298--><a name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
298</span>though my Farm has good room, my Hostess would fret 
herself to entertain a Lady suitably, and that I would avoid, 
especially toward Harvest time.&nbsp; Will Mrs. Carlyle believe 
this?</p>
<p style="text-align: right">E. F. G.</p>
<p>P.S.&nbsp; Bring some Books.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t find 
yourself well, or at ease, with us, you have really but to go off
without any sort of Ceremony as soon as you like: so don&rsquo;t 
tie yourself to any time at all.&nbsp; If the weather be fair, I 
predict you will like a week; and I shall like as much more as 
you please; leaving you mainly to your own devices all the 
while.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Chelsea</span>, 
7 <i>Aug</i><sup><i>t</i></sup>. 1855.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Fitzgerald</span>,</p>
<p>In spite of these heavy showers, I persist in believing the 
weather will clear, and means really to be dry: at any rate I am 
not made of sugar or of salt; so intend to be off 
to-morrow;&mdash;and am, even now, in all the horrors of a half 
rotted ship, which has lain two years, dead, among the ooze, and 
is now trying to get up its anchor again: ropes breaking, sails 
holed, blocks giving way, you may fancy what a pother there 
is!</p>
<p>My train is to be 11 a.m. from Shoreditch; which gets to 
Ipswich about two?&nbsp; If you have a gig and pony, of course it
will be pleasant to see your face at the end of my shrieking, 
mad, (and to me quite horrible) rail operations: but if I see 
nothing, I will courageously go for the Coach, and shall do quite
well there, if <!-- page 299--><a name="page299"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 299</span>I can get on the outside 
especially.&nbsp; So don&rsquo;t mind which way it is; a 
<i>small</i> weight ought to turn it either way.&nbsp; I hope to 
get to Farlingay not long after 4 o&rsquo;clock, and have a quiet
mutton chop in due time, and have a d&deg; pipe or pipes: nay I 
could even have a bathe if there was any sea water left in the 
evening.&nbsp; If you did come to Ipswich, an hour (hardly more) 
to glance at the old Town might not be amiss.</p>
<p>I will bring Books enough with me: I am used to several hours 
of solitude every day; and cannot be said ever to <i>weary</i> of
being left well alone.&nbsp; But we will &lsquo;drive&rsquo; to 
any places you recommend; do bidding of the omens, to a fair 
degree withal: in short I calculate on getting some real benefit 
by this plunge into the maritime rusticities under your friendly

<p>My wife firmly intended writing to you to-day, and perhaps has
done so; but if not, you are to take it as a thing done, for

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Fitzgerald</span>,</p>
<p>Here, after a good deal of bothering to improve it, above all 
to abridge it, is the proposed Inscription for the Pillar at 
Naseby.&nbsp; You need not scruple a moment to make any change 
that strikes you; I am well aware <!-- page 300--><a 
name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 300</span>it is good 
for nothing except its practical object, and that I have no skill
in lapidary literature.</p>
<p>The worst thing will be, discovering the <i>date</i> of your 
Naseby diggings.&nbsp; I ought to have it here; and probably I 
have,&mdash;in some remote dusty trunk, whither it is a terror to
go looking for it!&nbsp; Try you what you can, and the Naseby 
Farmer too (if he is still extant); then I will try.&nbsp; At 
worst we can say &lsquo;Ten years ago&rsquo;; but the exact date 
would be better.</p>
<p>The figure of the stone ought to be of Egyptian simplicity: a 
broadish parallelopipedon (or rather <i>octaedron</i>; the 
<i>corners</i> well chamfered off, to avoid breakages, will make 
it 8-faced, I think); in the substance of the stone there is one 
quality to be looked for, durability; and the letters ought to be
cut deep,&mdash;and by no means in lapidary <i>lines</i> (attend 
to that!), but simply like <i>two verses of the Bible</i>, so 
that he who runs may read.&nbsp; I rather like the <i>Siste 
Viator</i>,&mdash;yet will let you blot it out,&mdash;it is as 
applicable as to any Roman Tomb, and more so than to ours, which 
are in enclosed places, where any &lsquo;Traveller,&rsquo; if he 
either &lsquo;stop&rsquo; or go, will presently have the 
constable upon him.&nbsp; This is all I have to say about the 
stone; and I recommend that it be now done straightway, before 
you quit hold of that troublesome locality.</p>
<p>I find I must not promise to myself to go thither with you; 
alas, nor at all.&nbsp; I cannot get to sleep again since I came 
out of Suffolk: the stillness of Farlingay is unattainable in 
Chelsea for a <i>second</i> sleep, so I have to be content with 
the first, which is oftenest about 5 hours, and a very poor 
allowance for the afflicted son of Adam.&nbsp; I feel privately 
confident I <i>have</i> got good by my Suffolk <!-- page 301--><a
name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>visit, and 
by all the kindness of my beneficent brother mortals to me there:
but in the meanwhile it has &lsquo;stirred up a good deal of 
bile,&rsquo; I suppose; and we must wait.</p>
<p>London is utterly vacant to me, of all but noises from 
Cremorne and such sources: there is not in Britain a better place
for work than this Garret, if one had strength or heart for 
fronting work to any purpose.&nbsp; I try a little, but mostly 
with very small result.</p>
<p>If you know <i>Glyde</i> of Ipswich, and can understand him to
be really worth subscribing for, pray put down your name and 
mine, as a bit of duty; if not, not,&mdash;and burn his 
letter.</p>
<p>I send the heartiest thanks, and remembrances to kind Mrs. 
Smith, and all the industrious Harvesters; also to Papa and the 
young lady at Bredfield:&mdash;as I well may!&mdash;I recommend 
myself to your prayers; and hope to come again, if I live, when 
you have set your own house in order.&nbsp; Yours, dear F., with 
true regards,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Fitzgerald</span>,</p>
<p>I have been here ever since the day you last heard of me; 
leading the strangest life of absolute <i>Latrappism</i>; and 
often enough remembering Farlingay and you.&nbsp; I live 
perfectly alone, and without speech at all,&mdash;there being in 
fact nobody to speak to, except one austerely punctual housemaid,
who does her functions, like an eight-day clock, generally 
without bidding.&nbsp; My wife comes out now and then to give the
requisite directions; but commonly withdraws again on the morrow,
leaving the monster to himself and his own ways.&nbsp; I have 
Books; a complete Edition of <i>Voltaire</i>, <a 
name="citation302b"></a><a href="#footnote302b" 
class="citation">[302b]</a> for one Book, in which I read for 
<i>use</i>, or for idleness oftenest,&mdash;getting into endless 
reflexions over it, mostly of a sad and not very utterable 
nature.&nbsp; I find V. a &lsquo;gentleman,&rsquo; living in a 
world partly furnished with such; and that there are now almost 
no &lsquo;gentlemen&rsquo; (not quite <i>none</i>): this is one 
great head of my reflexions, to which there is no visible 
<i>tail</i> or finish.&nbsp; I have also a Horse (borrowed <!-- 
page 303--><a name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
303</span>from my fat Yeoman friend, who is at sea bathing in 
Sussex); and I go riding, at great lengths daily, over hill and 
dale: this I believe is really the main good I am doing,&mdash;if
in this either there be much good.&nbsp; But it is a strange way 
of life to me, for the time; perhaps not unprofitable: To let 
<i>Chaos</i> say out its say, then, and one&rsquo;s Evil Genius 
give one the very worst language he has, for a while.&nbsp; It is
still to last for a week or more.&nbsp; To day, for the first 
time, I ride back to Chelsea, but mean to return hither on 
Monday.&nbsp; There is a great circle of yellow light all the way
from Shooter&rsquo;s Hill to Primrose Hill, spread round my 
horizon every night, I see it while smoking my pipe before bed 
(so bright, last night, it cast a visible shadow of me against 
the white window-shutters); and this is all I have to do with 
London and its <i>gases</i> for a fortnight or more.&nbsp; My 
wife writes to me, there was an awful jangle of bells last day 
she went home from this; a Quaker asked in the railway, of some 
porter, &lsquo;Can thou tell me what these bells 
mean?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Well, I suppose something is up.&nbsp; 
They say Sebastopol is took, and the Rushans run 
away.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>&Agrave; la bonne heure</i>: but 
won&rsquo;t they come back again, think you?</p>
<p>On the whole I say, when you get your little Suffolk cottage, 
you must have in it a &lsquo;chamber in the wall&rsquo; for me, 
<i>plus</i> a pony that can trot, and a cow that gives good milk:
with these outfits we shall make a pretty rustication now and 
then, not wholly <i>Latrappish</i>, but only <i>half</i>, on much
easier terms than here; and I shall be right willing to come and 
try it, I for one party.&mdash;Meanwhile, I hope the Naseby 
matter is steadily going ahead; sale <i>completed</i>; and even 
the <i>monument</i> concern <!-- page 304--><a 
name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 304</span>making 
way.&nbsp; Tell me a little how that and other matters are.&nbsp;
If you are at home, a line is rapidly conveyed hither, steam all 
the way: after the beginning of the next week, I am at Chelsea, 
and (I dare say) there is a fire in the evenings now to welcome 
you there.&nbsp; Shew face in some way or other.</p>
<p>And so adieu; for my hour of riding is at hand.</p>

<p>. . . You never say a word about your Hafiz.&nbsp; Has that 
fallen for the present, Austin not daring to embark in it in 
these days of war, when nothing that is not warlike sells except 
Macaulay?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t suppose I bandy compliments; but, 
with moderate care, any such Translation of such a writer as 
Hafiz by you into pure, sweet, and partially measured Prose must 
be better than what I am doing for J&aacute;m&iacute;; <a 
name="citation304"></a><a href="#footnote304" 
class="citation">[304]</a> whose ingenuous prattle I am stilting 
into too Miltonic verse.&nbsp; This I am very sure of.&nbsp; But 
it is done.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[<i>Jan</i>. 1856.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cowell</span>,</p>
<p>I send you a sketch of J&aacute;m&iacute;&rsquo;s Life, which 
cut, correct, and annotate as you like.&nbsp; Where there was 
<!-- page 305--><a name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
305</span>so little to tell I have brought in all the fine Names 
and extra bits I could to give it a little sparkle.&nbsp; There 
is very little after all; I have spread it over Paper to give you
room to note <i>upon</i> it.&nbsp; Only take care not to lose 
either these, or Yesterday&rsquo;s, Papers&mdash;for my Terror at
going over the Ground!</p>
<p>You must put in the corrected Notice about the Sultan Hussein,
both in the Memoir and in the Note to the Poem.&nbsp; The latter 
will have room for at least four (I think five) lines of note 
Type: which you must fill, and not overflow: &lsquo;Strong 
without rage, etc.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I feel guilty at taking up your Time and Thoughts: and also at
Dressing myself so in your Plumes.&nbsp; But I mean to say a word
about this, &phi;&omega;&nu;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&alpha; 
&sigma;&upsilon;&nu;&epsilon;&tau;&omicron;&iota;&sigma;&iota;&nu;,
in my Preliminary Notice; and would gladly dedicate the little 
Book to you by Name, with due acknowledgment, did I think the 
world would take it for a Compliment to you.&nbsp; But though I 
like the Version, and you like it, we know very well the 
world&mdash;even the very little world, I mean, who will see 
it&mdash;may not; and might laugh at us both for any such 
Compliment.&nbsp; They cannot laugh at your Scholarship; but they
might laugh at the use I put it to: and at my dedicating a 
<i>cobweb</i> (as Carlyle called Maud the other night) to 
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cowell</span>,</p>
<p>Do make a sign of some sort to me.&nbsp; I sent you a string 
of Questions about Sal&aacute;m&aacute;n last week, all of which 
I did not want you to answer <i>at once</i>, but wishing at least
to hear if you had leisure and Inclination to meddle with 
them.&nbsp; There is no reason in the world you should unless you
really have Time and Liking.&nbsp; If you <i>have</i>, I will 
send you the Proofs of the Little Book which Mr. Childs is even 
now putting in hand.&nbsp; Pray let me know as soon as you can 
what and how much of all this will be agreeable to you.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t tell me how Hafiz gets on.&nbsp; There is one 
thing which I think I find in Sal&aacute;m&aacute;n which may be 
worth your consideration (not needing much) in Hafiz: namely, in 
Translation to retain the original Persian Names as much as 
possible&mdash;&lsquo;Shah&rsquo; for &lsquo;king&rsquo; for 
instance&mdash;&lsquo;Y&#363;suf and Suleyman&rsquo; for 
&lsquo;Joseph and Solomon,&rsquo; etc.&nbsp; The Persian is not 
only more musical, but removes such words and names further from 
Europe and European Prejudices and Associations.&nbsp; So also I 
think best to talk of &lsquo;<i>A Moon</i>&rsquo; rather than 
&lsquo;<i>a Month</i>,&rsquo; and perhaps &lsquo;sennight&rsquo; 
is better than &lsquo;week.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This is a little matter; but it is well to rub off as little 
Oriental Colour as possible.</p>
<p>As to a Notice of J&aacute;m&iacute;&rsquo;s Life, you need 
not trouble yourself to draw it up unless you like; since I can 
<!-- page 307--><a name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
307</span>make an extract of Ouseley&rsquo;s, and send you for 
any addition or correction you like.&nbsp; Very little needs be 
said.&nbsp; I have not yet been able to find J&aacute;m&iacute; 
out in the Biographie Universelle. . . .</p>
<p>Now let me hear from you <i>something</i>&mdash;whatever you 
like.&nbsp; Yours and Lady&rsquo;s, E. F. G.</p>
<p>You, I believe, in your Oxford Essay, translate 
J&aacute;m&iacute;&rsquo;s &lsquo;Haft Aurang&rsquo; as the 
&lsquo;<i>Seven Thrones</i>,&rsquo; it also meaning, I see, the 
seven Stars of the Great Bear&mdash;&lsquo;The Seven 
Stars.&rsquo;&nbsp; Why should not this latter be the 
Translation? more intelligible, Poetical, and Eastern (as far as 
I see) than &lsquo;Thrones.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lady</span>,</p>
<p>The Picture after all did not go down yesterday as I meant, 
but shall and will go to-morrow (Saturday).&nbsp; Also I shall 
send you dear Major Moor&rsquo;s &lsquo;Oriental 
Fragments&rsquo;; an almost worthless Book, I doubt, to those who
did not know him&mdash;which means, <i>love</i> him! <a 
name="citation307"></a><a href="#footnote307" 
class="citation">[307]</a>&nbsp; And somehow all of us in our 
corner of Suffolk knew something of him: and so again loved 
something of him.&nbsp; For there was nothing at all <!-- page 
308--><a name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
308</span>about him not to be beloved.&nbsp; Ah! I think how 
interested he would have been with all this Persian: and how we 
should have disputed over parts and expressions over a glass of 
his Shiraz wine (for he had some) in his snug Parlour, or in his 
Cornfields when the Sun fell upon the latest Gleaners!&nbsp; He 
is dead, and you will go where he lived, to be dead to me!</p>
<p>Remember to take poor Barton&rsquo;s little Book <a 
name="citation308a"></a><a href="#footnote308a" 
class="citation">[308a]</a> with you to India; better than many a
better Book to you there!</p>
<p>I got a glimpse of Professor M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s Essay <a 
name="citation308b"></a><a href="#footnote308b" 
class="citation">[308b]</a>&mdash;full of fine things; but I 
hardly gather it up into a good whole, which is very likely my 
fault; from hasty perusal, ignorance, or other Incapacity.&nbsp; 
Perhaps, on the other hand, he found the Subject too great for 
his Space; and so has left it disproportioned, which the German 
is not inapt to do.&nbsp; But one may be well thankful for such 
admirable fragments, perhaps left so in the very honesty that is 
above rounding them into a specious Theory which will not 
hold.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[1856.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lady</span>,</p>
<p>. . . If you see Trench&rsquo;s new Book about Calderon <a 
name="citation308c"></a><a href="#footnote308c" 
class="citation">[308c]</a> you will see he has dealt very 
handsomely <!-- page 309--><a name="page309"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 309</span>with me.&nbsp; He does not approve 
the Principle I went on; and what has he made of his own!&nbsp; I
say this with every reason, as you will see, to praise him for 
his good word.&nbsp; He seems to me wrong about his 
&lsquo;asonantes,&rsquo; which were much better 
<i>un</i>-assonanted as Cowell did his Specimens. <a 
name="citation309"></a><a href="#footnote309" 
class="citation">[309]</a>&nbsp; With Trench the Language has to 
be forced to secure the shadow of a Rhyme which is no pleasure to
the Ear.&nbsp; So it seems to me on a hasty Look.</p>

<p>Mr. Cowell was appointed Professor of History at the 
Presidency College, Calcutta, in 1856, and went out to India by 
the Cape in August, greatly to FitzGerald&rsquo;s regret.&nbsp;

<p>As usual I blunder.&nbsp; I have been taking for granted all 
this while that of course we could not write to you till you had 
written to us!&nbsp; Else how several times I could have written!
could have sent you some Lines of Hafiz or J&aacute;m&iacute; or 
Niz&aacute;m&iacute; that I <!-- page 310--><a 
name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 310</span>thought 
wanted Comment of some kind: so as the Atlantic should have been 
no greater Bar between us than the two hours rail to 
Oxford.&nbsp; And now I have forgot many things, or have left the
Books scattered in divers places; or, if I had all here, 
&rsquo;twould be too much to send.&nbsp; So I must e&rsquo;en 
take up with what the present Hour turns up.</p>
<p>It was only yesterday I heard from your Brother of a Letter 
from you, telling of your safe Arrival; of the Dark Faces about 
you at your Calcutta Caravanserai!&nbsp; Methinks how I should 
like to be there!&nbsp; Perhaps should not, though, were the 
Journey only half its length!&nbsp; Write to me one day. . . 
.</p>
<p>I have now been five weeks alone at my old Lodgings in London 
where you came this time last year!&nbsp; My wife in 
Norfolk.&nbsp; She came up yesterday; and we have taken Lodgings 
for two months in the Regent&rsquo;s Park.&nbsp; And I positively
stay behind here in the old Place on purpose to write to you in 
the same condition you knew me in and I you!&nbsp; I believe 
there are new Channels fretted in my Cheeks with many unmanly 
Tears since then, &lsquo;remembering the Days that are no 
more,&rsquo; in which you two are so mixt up.&nbsp; Well, well; I
have no news to tell you.&nbsp; Public Matters you know I 
don&rsquo;t meddle with; and I have seen scarce any Friends even 
while in London here.&nbsp; Carlyle but once; Thackeray not once;
Spedding and Donne pretty often.&nbsp; Spedding&rsquo;s first 
volume of Bacon is out; some seven hundred pages; and the Reviews
already begin to think it over-commentaried.&nbsp; <!-- page 
311--><a name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
311</span>How interested would you be in it! and from you I 
should get a good Judgment, which perhaps I can&rsquo;t make for 
myself.&nbsp; I hear Tennyson goes on with King Arthur; but I 
have not seen or heard from him for a long long while.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, as I finished the last sentence, Thackeray was 
announced; he came in looking gray, grand, and good-humoured; and
I held up this Letter and told him whom it was written to and he 
sends his Love!&nbsp; He goes Lecturing all over England; has 
fifty pounds for each Lecture: and says he is ashamed of the 
Fortune he is making.&nbsp; But he deserves it.</p>
<p>And now for my poor Studies.&nbsp; I have read really very 
little except Persian since you went: and yet, from want of Eyes,
not very much of that.&nbsp; I have gone carefully over 
two-thirds of Hafiz again with Dictionary and Von Hammer: and 
gone on with J&aacute;m&iacute; and Niz&aacute;m&iacute;.&nbsp; 
But my great Performance all lies in the last five weeks since I 
have been alone here; when I wrote to Napoleon Newton to ask him 
to lend me his MS. of Att&aacute;r&rsquo;s Mantic uttair; and, 
with the help of Garcin de Tassy <a name="citation311"></a><a 
href="#footnote311" class="citation">[311]</a> have nearly made 
out about two-thirds of it.&nbsp; For it has greatly interested 
me, though I confess it is always an old Story.&nbsp; The Germans
make a Fuss about the S&uacute;fi Doctrine; but, as far as I 
understand, it is not very abstruse <!-- page 312--><a 
name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 312</span>Pantheism, 
and always the same.&nbsp; One becomes as wearied of the 
<i>man-i</i> and <i>du-i</i> in their Philosophy as of the 
<i>bulbul</i>, etc., in their Songs.&nbsp; Att&aacute;r&rsquo;s 
Doctrine seems to me only J&aacute;m&iacute; and 
Jel&aacute;ledd&iacute;n (of whom I have poked out a little from 
the MS. you bought for me), but his Mantic has, like 
Sal&aacute;m&aacute;n, the advantage of having a Story to hang 
all upon; and some of his illustrative Stories are very 
agreeable: better than any of the others I have seen.&nbsp; He 
has not so much Fancy or Imagination as J&aacute;m&iacute;, nor I
dare say, so much depth as Jel&aacute;ledd&iacute;n; but his 
touch is lighter.&nbsp; I mean to make a Poetic Abstract of the 
Mantic, I think: neither De Tassy nor Von Hammer <a 
name="citation312"></a><a href="#footnote312" 
class="citation">[312]</a> gives these Stories which are by far 
the best part, though there are so many childish and silly 
ones.&nbsp; Shah M&aacute;hm&uacute;d figures in the best.&nbsp; 
I am very pleased at having got on so well with this MS. though I
doubt at more cost of Eyesight than it is worth.&nbsp; I have 
exchanged several Letters with Mr. Newton, though by various 
mischances we have not yet met; he has however introduced me to 
Mr. Dowson of the Asiatic, with whom, or with a certain Seyd 
Abd&uacute;llah recommended by Allen, I mean (I think) to read a 
little.&nbsp; No need of this had you remained behind!&nbsp; Oh! 
how I should like to read the Mantic with you!&nbsp; It is very 
easy in the main.&nbsp; But I believe I shall never see you 
again; I really do believe that.&nbsp; And my Paper is gradually 
overcome as I write this: and I must say Good Bye.&nbsp; Good 
Bye, my dear dear <!-- page 313--><a name="page313"></a><span

with Mr. and Mrs. Charlesworth. <a name="citation313"></a><a 
href="#footnote313" class="citation">[313]</a>&nbsp; Thackeray 
coming in overset me, with one thing and another.&nbsp; 
Farewell.&nbsp; Write to me; direct&mdash;whither?&nbsp; For till
I see better how we get on I dare fix on no place to live or die 
in.&nbsp; Direct to me at Crabbe&rsquo;s, Bredfield, till you

first Letter, arrived yours!&nbsp; And now, to make the

Birthday!&nbsp; I am extremely obliged to you for your long, 
kind, and interesting Letter: yes, yes: I should have liked to be
on the Voyage with you, and to be among the Dark People with you 
even now.&nbsp; Your Brother Charles, who came up yesterday, 
brought us up your Home Letter, and read it to us last night 
after Tea to our great Satisfaction.&nbsp; I believe that in my 
already posted Letter I have told you much that you enquire about
in yours received half an hour after: of my poor Studies at all 
events.&nbsp; This <!-- page 314--><a name="page314"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 314</span>morning I have been taking the 
Physiognomy of the 19th Birds. . . .&nbsp; There are, as I wrote 
you, very pleasant stories.&nbsp; One, of a Shah returning to his
Capital, and his People dressing out a Welcome for him, and 
bringing out Presents of Gold, Jewels, etc., all which he rides 
past without any Notice, till, coming to the Prison, the 
Prisoners, by way of their Welcome, toss before him the Bloody 
Heads and Limbs of old and recent Execution.&nbsp; At which the 
Shah for the first time stops his Horse&mdash;smiles&mdash;casts 
Largess among the Prisoners, etc.&nbsp; And when asked why he 
neglected all the Jewels, etc., and stopped with satisfaction at 
such a grim welcome as the Prisoners threw him, he says, 
&lsquo;The Jewels, etc., were but empty Ostentation&mdash;but 
those bloody Limbs prove that my Law has been executed, without 
which none of those Heads and Carcases would have parted Company,
etc.&rsquo;&nbsp; De Tassy notices a very agreeable Story of 
Mahm&uacute;d and the Lad fishing: and I find another as pleasant
about Mahm&uacute;d consorting &lsquo;incog:&rsquo; with a 
Bath-Stove-Keeper, who is so good a Fellow that, at last, 
Mahm&uacute;d, making himself known, tells the Poor Man to ask 
what he will&mdash;a Crown, if he likes.&nbsp; But the poor 
Fellow says, &lsquo;All I ask is that the Shah will come now and 
then to me as I am, and here where I am; here, in this poor 
Place, which he has made illustrious with his Presence, and a 
better Throne to me with Him, than the Throne of Both Worlds 
without Him, etc.&rsquo;&nbsp; You observed perhaps in De 
Tassy&rsquo;s Summary that he <!-- page 315--><a 
name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 315</span>notices an 
Eastern Form of William Tell&rsquo;s Apple?&nbsp; A Sultan doats 
on a beautiful Slave, who yet is seen daily to pine away under 
all the Shah&rsquo;s Favour, and being askt why, replies, 
&lsquo;Because every day the Shah, who is a famous Marksman with 
the Bow, shoots at an Apple laid on my Head, and always hits it; 
and when all the Court cries &ldquo;Lo! the Fortune of the 
King!&rdquo;&nbsp; He also asks me why I turn pale under the 
Trial, he being such a Marksman, and his Mark an Apple set on the
Head he most doats upon?&rsquo;&nbsp; I am going to transcribe on
the next Page a rough draft of a Version of another Story, 
because all this will amuse you, I think.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t 
help running some of these Apologues into Verse as I read them: 
but they are in a very rough state as yet, and so perhaps may 
continue, for to correct is <i>the</i> Bore.</p>
<blockquote><p>When Y&uacute;suf from his Father&rsquo;s House 
was torn,<br />
His Father&rsquo;s Heart was utterly forlorn;<br />
And, like a Pipe with but one note, his Tongue<br />
Still nothing but the name of Y&uacute;suf rung.<br />
Then down from Heaven&rsquo;s Branches came the Bird<br />
Of Heaven, and said &lsquo;God wearies of that Word.<br />
Hast thou not else to do, and else to say?&rsquo;<br />
So Yac&uacute;b&rsquo;s Lips were sealed from that Day.<br />
But one Night in a Vision, far away<br />
His Darling in some alien Home he saw,<br />
And stretch&rsquo;d his Arms forth; and between the Awe<br />
Of God&rsquo;s Displeasure, and the bitter Pass<br />
Of Love and Anguish, sigh&rsquo;d forth an <i>Alas</i>!<br />
And stopp&rsquo;d&mdash;But when he woke The Angel came,<br />
And said, &lsquo;Oh, faint of purpose!&nbsp; Though the Name<br 
/>
Of that Belov&egrave;d were not uttered by<br />
Thy Lips, it hung sequester&rsquo;d in that Sigh.&rsquo;</p>

316</span>You see this is very imperfect, and I am not always 
quite certain of always getting the right Sow by the Ear; but it 
is pretty anyhow.&nbsp; In this, as in several other Stories, one
sees the fierce vindictive Character of the Eastern Divinity and 
Religion: a &lsquo;jealous God&rsquo; indeed!&nbsp; So there is 
another Story of a poor Hermit, who retires into the Wilderness 
to be alone with God, and lives in a Tree; and there in the 
Branches a little Bird has a Nest, and sings so sweetly that the 
poor old Man&rsquo;s Heart is drawn to it in spite of Himself; 
till a Voice from Heaven calls to Him&mdash;&lsquo;What are you 
about?&nbsp; You have bought <i>Me</i> with your Prayers, etc.,

the Lecture. . . .&nbsp; I should like to see

Get me a MS. if you can get a fair one; as also one of 
Att&aacute;r&rsquo;s Birds; of which however Garcin de Tassy 
gives hint of publishing a Text.&nbsp; There might be a good Book
made of about half the Text of the Original; for the Repetitions 
are many, and the stories so many of them not wanted.&nbsp; What

<p>. . . March 12.&nbsp; You see I leave this Letter like an 
unfinished Picture; giving it a touch every now and then.&nbsp; 
Meanwhile it lies in a volume of <!-- page 318--><a 
name="page318"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 318</span>Sir W. 
Ouseley&rsquo;s Travels.&nbsp; Meanwhile also I keep putting into
shape some of that Mantic which however would never do to 
publish.&nbsp; For this reason; that anything like a literal 
Translation would be, I think, unreadable; and what I have done 
for amusement is not only so unliteral, but I doubt 
<i>unoriental</i>, in its form and expression, as would destroy 
the value of the Original without replacing it with anything 
worth reading of my own.&nbsp; It has amused me however to reduce
the Mass into something of an Artistic Shape.&nbsp; There are 
lots of Passages which&mdash;how should I like to talk them over 
with you!&nbsp; Shall we ever meet again?&nbsp; I think not; or 
not in such plight, both of us, as will make Meeting what it used
to be.&nbsp; Only to-day I have been opening dear old 
Sal&aacute;m&aacute;n: the original Copy we bought and began this
time three years ago at Oxford; with all my scratches of Query 
and Explanation in it, and the Notes from you among the 
Leaves.&nbsp; How often I think with Sorrow of my many 
Harshnesses and Impatiences! which are yet more of manner than 
Intention.&nbsp; My wife is sick of hearing me sing in a doleful 
voice the old Glee of &lsquo;When shall we Three Meet 
again?&rsquo;&nbsp; Especially the Stanza, &lsquo;Though in 
foreign Lands we sigh, Parcht beneath a hostile Sky, 
etc.&rsquo;&nbsp; How often too I think of the grand Song written
by some Scotch Lady, <a name="citation318"></a><a 
href="#footnote318" class="citation">[318]</a> which I sing to 
myself for you on Ganges Banks!</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 319--><a name="page319"></a><span

desires,<br />
The Sun from India&rsquo;s Shore retires:<br />
To <i>Orwell&rsquo;s</i> Bank, with temperate ray&mdash;<br />
Home of my Youth!&mdash;he leads the Day:<br />
Oh Banks to me for ever dear,<br />
Oh Stream whose Murmur meets my Ear;<br />
Oh all my Hopes of Bliss abide<br />
Where Orwell mingles with the Tide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Music has come to me for these Words, little good 
otherwise than expressive: but there is no use sending it to 
India.&nbsp; To India!&nbsp; It seems to me it would be easy to 
get into the first great Ship and never see Land again till I saw
the Mouth of the Ganges! and there live what remains of my shabby
Life.</p>
<p>But there is no good in all such Talk.&nbsp; I never write to 
you about Politics in which you know I little meddle. . . .&nbsp;
March 20.&nbsp; Why, see how the Time goes!&nbsp; And here has my
Letter been lying in Sir W. Ouseley for the last ten days, I 
suppose.&nbsp; To-day I have been writing twenty pages of a 
metrical Sketch of the Mantic, for such uses as I told you 
of.&nbsp; It is an amusement to me to take what Liberties I like 
with these Persians, who (as I think) are not Poets enough to 
frighten one from such excursions, and who really do want a 
little Art to shape them.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t speak of 
Jel&aacute;ledd&iacute;n whom I know so little of (enough to show
me that he is no great Artist, however), nor of Hafiz, whose 
<i>best</i> is untranslatable because he is the best Musician of 
Words.&nbsp; Old Johnson <a name="citation319"></a><a 
href="#footnote319" class="citation">[319]</a> said <!-- page 
320--><a name="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
320</span>the Poets were the best Preservers of a Language: for 
People must go to the Original to relish them.&nbsp; I am sure 
that what Tennyson said to you is true: that Hafiz is the most 
Eastern&mdash;or, he should have said, most 
<i>Persian</i>&mdash;of the Persians.&nbsp; He is the best 
representative of their character, whether his S&aacute;ki and 
Wine be real or mystical.&nbsp; Their Religion and Philosophy is 
soon seen through, and always seems to me <i>cuckooed</i> over 
like a borrowed thing, which people, once having got, don&rsquo;t
know how to parade enough.&nbsp; To be sure, their Roses and 
Nightingales are repeated enough; but Hafiz and old Omar 
Khayy&aacute;m ring like true Metal.&nbsp; The Philosophy of the 
Latter is, alas!, one that never fails in the World.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;To-day is ours, etc.&rsquo;</p>
<p>While I think of it, why is the Sea <a 
name="citation320"></a><a href="#footnote320" 
class="citation">[320]</a> (in that Apologue of Att&aacute;r once
quoted by Falconer) supposed to have lost God?&nbsp; Did the 
Persians agree with something I remember in Plato about the Sea 
and all in it being of an inferior Nature, in spite of 
Homer&rsquo;s &lsquo;divine Ocean, etc.&rsquo;&nbsp; And here I 
come to the end of my sheet, which you will hardly get through, I
think.&nbsp; I scarce dare to think of reading it over.&nbsp; But
I will try.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cowell</span>,</p>
<p>I only posted my last long letter four days ago: and how far 
shall I get with this?&nbsp; Like the other, I keep it in Sir W. 
Ouseley, and note down a bit now and then.&nbsp; When the time 
for the Mail comes, the sheet shall go whether full or not.&nbsp;
I had a letter from your Mother telling me she had heard from 
you&mdash;all well&mdash;but the Heats increasing.&nbsp; I 
suppose the Crocuses we see even in these poor little Gardens 
hereabout would wither in a Glance of your Sun.&nbsp; Now the 
black Trees in the Regent&rsquo;s Park opposite are beginning to 
show green Buds; and Men come by with great Baskets of Flowers; 
Primroses, Hepaticas, Crocuses, great Daisies, etc., calling as 
they go, &lsquo;Growing, Growing, Growing!&nbsp; All the Glory 
going!&rsquo;&nbsp; So my wife says she has heard them call: some
old Street cry, no doubt, of which we have so few now 
remaining.&nbsp; It will almost make you smell them all the way 
from Calcutta.&nbsp; &lsquo;All the Glory going!&rsquo;&nbsp; 
What has put me upon beginning with this Sheet so soon is, that, 
(having done my Will for the present with the Mantic&mdash;one 
reason being that I am afraid to meddle more with N. 
Newton&rsquo;s tender MS., and another reason that I now lay by 
what I have sketched out so as to happen on it again one day with
fresh eyes)&mdash;I say, this <!-- page 322--><a 
name="page322"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 322</span>being 
shelved, I took up old Hafiz again, and began with him where I 
left off in November at Brighton.&nbsp; And this morning came to 
an ode we did together this time two years ago when you were at 
Spiers&rsquo; in Oxford. . . .&nbsp; How it brought all back to 
me!&nbsp; Oriel opposite, and the Militia in Broad Street, and 
the old Canary-coloured Sofa and the Cocoa or Tea on the Table! .
. .</p>
<p>I should think Bramford begins to look pretty about this time,
hey, Mr. Cowell?&nbsp; And Mrs. Cowell?&nbsp; There is a house 
there constantly advertised to let in the Papers.&nbsp; I think 
that one by the Mill; not the pleasant place where 
<i>Tryg&aelig;us</i> <a name="citation322"></a><a 
href="#footnote322" class="citation">[322]</a> looked forth on 
the Rail!&nbsp; &lsquo;The Days are gone when Beauty bright, 
etc.&rsquo; . . .</p>
<p>Spedding has been once here in near three months.&nbsp; His 
Bacon keeps coming out: his part, the Letters, etc., of Bacon, is
not come yet; so it remains to be seen what he will do then: but 
I can&rsquo;t help thinking he has let the Pot boil too 
long.&nbsp; Well, here is a great deal written to-day: and I 
shall shut up the Sheet in Ouseley again.&nbsp; March 30.&nbsp; 
Another reason for thinking the <i>m&aacute;hi</i> which supports
the world to be only a <i>myth</i> of the simple Fish genus is 
that the stage next above him is <i>Gau</i>, the Bull, as the 
Symbol of <i>Earth</i>.&nbsp; It seems to me one sees this as it 
were pictured in those Assyrian Sculptures; just some waving 
lines and a fish to represent Water, etc.&nbsp; And it hooks <!--
page 323--><a name="page323"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
323</span>on, I think, to Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s Theory in that 
Essay <a name="citation323a"></a><a href="#footnote323a" 
class="citation">[323a]</a> of his.&nbsp; Saturday, April 
4.&nbsp; Why, we are creeping toward another Post day! another 
25th when the &lsquo;Vi&acirc; Marseilles&rsquo; Letters go 
off!&nbsp; And I now renew this great Sheet, because in returning
to old Hafiz two or three days ago, I happened on a line which 
you will confer with a Tetrastich of Omar&rsquo;s. . . .&nbsp; 
Donne has got the Licenser&rsquo;s Post; given him in the 
handsomest way by Lord Bredalbane to whom the Queen as handsomely
committed it.&nbsp; The said Donne has written an Article on 
Calderon in Fraser, <a name="citation323b"></a><a 
href="#footnote323b" class="citation">[323b]</a> in which he says
very handsome things of me, but is not accurate in what he 
says.&nbsp; I suppose it was he wrote an Article in the Saturday 
Review some months ago to the same effect; but I have not asked 
him.&nbsp; I find people like that Calderon book.&nbsp; By the 
bye again, what is the passage I am to write out for you from the
Volume you gave me, the old Bramford Volume, &lsquo;E. B. Cowell,
Bramford, Aug. 20, 1849?&rsquo;&nbsp; Tell me, and I will write 
it in my best style: I have the Volume here in my room, and was 
looking into it only last night; at that end of the M&aacute;gico
which we read together at Elmsett!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know if I 
could translate it now that the &lsquo;<i>&aelig;stus&rsquo;</i> 
caught from your sympathy is gone! . . .&nbsp; April 5.&nbsp; In 
looking into the &lsquo;Secreto Agravio&rsquo; I see an Oriental 
superstition, which was likely enough however to <!-- page 
324--><a name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 324</span>be
a poetical fancy of any nation: I mean, the Sun turning Stone to 
Ruby, etc.&nbsp; Enter Don Luis: &lsquo;Soy mercador, y trato en 
los Diamantes, que hoy son Piedras, y rayos fueron antes de Sol, 
que perficiona &eacute; ilumina r&uacute;stico Grano en la 
abrasada Mina.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Partridge in the Mantic tells 
something of the same; he digs up and swallows Rubies which turn 
his Blood to Fire inside him and sparkle out of his Eyes and 
Bill.&nbsp; This volume of Calderon is marked by the Days on 
which you finished several Plays, all at Bramford!&nbsp; 
Wednesday, April 8.&nbsp; I have been reading the 
&lsquo;M&aacute;gico&rsquo; over and remembering other days; I 
saw us sitting at other tables reading it.&nbsp; Also I am 
looking over old &AElig;schylus&mdash;Agamemnon&mdash;with 
Blackie&rsquo;s Translation. . . .&nbsp; Is it in Hafiz we have 
met the Proverb (about <i>pregnant</i> Night) which Clytemnestra 
also makes her Entry with [264, 5]?

&mu;&eta;&tau;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf; 
&epsilon;&upsilon;&phi;&rho;&omicron;&nu;&eta;&sigmaf; 
&pi;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;.&nbsp; I think one sees that the Oriental
borrowed this Fancy, which smacks of the Grecian Personification 
of Mother Night.&nbsp; What an Epitaph for a Warrior are those 
two Greek words by which the Chorus express all that returns to 
Mycen&aelig; of the living Hero who went forth 
[435]&mdash;&tau;&epsilon;&upsilon;&chi;&eta; 
&kappa;&alpha;&iota; 
&sigma;&pi;&omicron;&delta;&omicron;&sigmaf;!</p>
<p>Well; and I have had a Note from Garcin de Tassy whom I had 
asked if he knew of any Copy of Omar Khayy&aacute;m in all the 
Paris Libraries: he writes &lsquo;I have made, by means of a 
Friend, etc.&rsquo;&nbsp; But I shall enclose his Note to amuse 
you.&nbsp; Now what <!-- page 325--><a name="page325"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 325</span>I mean to do is, in return for his 
politeness to me, to copy out as well as I can the Tetrastichs as
you copied them for me, and send them as a Present to De 
Tassy.&nbsp; Perhaps he will edit them.&nbsp; I should not wish 
him to do so if there were any chance of your ever doing it; but 
I don&rsquo;t think you will help on the old Pantheist, and De 
Tassy really, after what he is doing for the Mantic, deserves to 
make the acquaintance of this remarkable little Fellow.&nbsp; 
Indeed I think you will be pleased that I should do this.&nbsp; 
Now for some more &AElig;schylus.&nbsp; Friday, April 17.&nbsp; I
have been for the last five days with my Brother at Twickenham; 
during which time I really copied out Omar Khayy&aacute;m, in a 
way! and shall to-day post it as a &lsquo;<i>cadeau&rsquo;</i> to
Garcin de Tassy in return for his Courtesy to me.&nbsp; I am 
afraid, a bad return: for my MS. is but badly written and it 
would perhaps more plague than profit an English 
&lsquo;savant&rsquo; to have such a present made him.&nbsp; But a
Frenchman gets over all this very lightly.&nbsp; Garcin de Tassy 
tells me he has printed four thousand lines of the Mantic.&nbsp; 
And here is April running away and it will soon be time to post 
you another Letter!&nbsp; When I once get into the Country I 
shall have less to write you about than now; and that, you see, 
is not much.</p>
<p>Tuesday, April 21.&nbsp; Yours and your wife&rsquo;s dear good
Letters put into my hand as I sit in the sunshine in a little 
Balcony outside the Windows <!-- page 326--><a 
name="page326"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 326</span>looking 
upon the quite green hedge side of the Regent&rsquo;s Park.&nbsp;
For Green it is thus early, and such weather as I never remember 
before at this Season.&nbsp; Well, your Letters, I say, were put 
into my hand as I was there looking into &AElig;schylus under an 
Umbrella, and waiting for Breakfast.&nbsp; My wife cried a good 
deal over your wife&rsquo;s Letter, I think, I think so.&nbsp; Ah
me!&nbsp; I would not as yet read it, for I was already sad; but 
I shall answer hers to me which I did read indeed with many 
thoughts: perhaps I can write this post; at least I will clear 
off this letter to you, my dear Cowell.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">E. F. G.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>April</i> 21.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lady</span>, I have told E. B. C. 
at the close of my long letter to him how his and yours were put 
into my hand this morning.&nbsp; Well, as in telling him that I 
finished that sheet of Paper, I will e&rsquo;en take one scrap 
more to thank you; and (since you have, I believe, some 
confidences together) some things I have yet got to say to him 
shall be addressed to you; and you can exercise your own 
Discretion as to telling him.&nbsp; One thing tell him however, 
which my overflowing Sheet had not room for, and was the very 
thing that most needed telling: viz. that he, a busy man, must 
not feel bound to write me as long Letters in return.&nbsp; Who 
knows how long I shall keep up any thing like to my own mark; for
I daily grow worse with the <!-- page 327--><a 
name="page327"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 327</span>Letter-pen:
and, beside his other employments, the Sun of India will 
&lsquo;<i>belaze&rsquo;</i> him (I doubt if the word be in 
Johnson).&nbsp; But &lsquo;vogue la Gal&egrave;re&rsquo; while 
the wind blows!&nbsp; Again you may give him the enclosed instead
of a former Letter from the same G. de T.&nbsp; For is it not odd
he should not have time to read a dozen of those 150 
Tetrastichs?&nbsp; I pointed out such a dozen to him of the best,
and told him if he liked them I would try and get the rest better
written for him than I could write.&nbsp; I had also told him 
that the whole thing came from E. B. C. and I now write to tell 
him I have no sort of intention of writing a paper in the Journal
Asiatique, nor I suppose E. B. C. neither.&nbsp; G. de Tassy is 
very civil to me however.&nbsp; How much I might say about your 
Letter to me! you will hardly comprehend how it is I almost turn 
my Eyes from it in this Answer, and dally with other 
matter.&nbsp; You make me sad with old Memories; yet, I 
don&rsquo;t mean quite disagreeably sad, but enough to make me 
shrink recurring to them.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know whether to be 
comforted or not when <i>you</i> talk of India as a Land of 
Exile&mdash;. . .</p>
<p>Wednesday, April 22.&nbsp; Now this morning comes a second 
Letter from Garcin de Tassy saying that his first note about Omar
Khayyam was &lsquo;in haste&rsquo;: that he has read some of the 
Tetrastichs which he finds not very difficult; some difficulties 
which are probably errors of the &lsquo;copist&rsquo;; and he 
proposes his writing an Article in the Journal Asiatique on it in
<!-- page 328--><a name="page328"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
328</span>which he will &lsquo;honourably mention&rsquo; E. B. C.
and E. F. G.&nbsp; I now write to deprecate all this: <a 
name="citation328"></a><a href="#footnote328" 
class="citation">[328]</a> putting it on the ground (and a fair 
one) that we do not yet know enough of the matter: that I do not 
wish E. B. C. to be made answerable for errors which E. F. G. 
(the &lsquo;<i>copist&rsquo;</i>) may have made: and that E. F. 
G. neither merits nor desires any honourable mention as a Persian
Scholar: being none.&nbsp; Tell E. B. C. that I have used his 
name with all caution, referring De Tassy to Vararuchi, 
etc.&nbsp; But these Frenchmen are so self-content and 
superficial, one never knows how they will take up 
anything.&nbsp; To turn to other matters&mdash;we are talking of 
leaving this place almost directly. . . .&nbsp; I often wonder if
I shall ever see you both again!&nbsp; Well, for the present, 
Adieu, Adieu, Adieu!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cowell</span>,</p>
<p>Owing partly to my own Stupidity, and partly to a change in 
the India Post days, my last two letters (to you and wife) which 
were quite ready by the Marseilles Post of April 25th will not 
get off till the Southampton Mail of this May 10.&nbsp; Your 
letter of March 21 reached me three days ago.&nbsp; Write only 
when you have Leisure and Inclination, and only as much as those 
two good things are good for: I will <!-- page 329--><a 
name="page329"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 329</span>do the 
same.&nbsp; I will at once say (in reply to a kind offer you make
to have Hatifi&rsquo;s &lsquo;Haft Paikar&rsquo; copied for me) 
that it will [be] best to wait till you have read it; you know me
well enough to know whether it will hit my taste.&nbsp; However, 
if it be but a very short poem, no harm would be done by a Copy: 
but do let me be at the Charges of such things.&nbsp; I will ask 
for Hatifi&rsquo;s Laili: but I didn&rsquo;t (as you know) take 
much to what little I saw.&nbsp; As to any copies Allen might 
have had, I believe there is no good asking for them: for, only 
yesterday going to put into Madden&rsquo;s hands Mr. 
Newton&rsquo;s MS. of the Mantic, I saw Allen&rsquo;s house 
<i>khar&aacute;b</i>.&nbsp; There had been a Fire there, Madden 
told me, which had destroyed stock, etc., but I could not make 
much out of the matter, Madden putting on a Face of foolish 
mystery.&nbsp; You can imagine it?&nbsp; We talked of you, as you
may imagine also: and I believe in that he is not foolish.&nbsp; 
Well, and to-day I have a note from the great De Tassy which 
announces, &lsquo;My dear Sir, Definitively I have written a 
little Paper upon Omar with some Quotations taken here and there 
at random, avoiding only the too badly sounding 
<i>rubay&aacute;t</i>.&nbsp; I have read that paper before the 
Persian Ambassador and suite, at a meeting of the Oriental 
Society of which I am Vice President, the Duc de Dondeauville 
being president.&nbsp; The Ambassador has been much pleased of my
quotations.&rsquo;&nbsp; So you see I have done the part of an 
ill Subject in helping France to ingratiate herself with Persia 
when England might have had the <!-- page 330--><a 
name="page330"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
330</span>start!&nbsp; I suppose it probable <i>Ferukh Khan</i> 
himself had never read or perhaps heard of Omar.&nbsp; I think I 
told you in my last that I had desired De Tassy to say nothing 
about you in any Paper he should write; since I cannot have you 
answerable for any blunders I may have made in my Copy, nor may 
you care to be named with Omar at all.&nbsp; I hope the Frenchman
will attend to my desire; and I dare say he will, as he will then
have all credit to himself.&nbsp; He says he can&rsquo;t make out
the metre of the <i>rubay&aacute;t</i> at all&mdash;never 
could&mdash;though &lsquo;I am enough skilful in scanning the 
Persian verses as you have seen&rsquo; (Q<sup>y</sup>?) &lsquo;in
my Prosody of the languages of Musulman Countries, 
etc.&rsquo;&nbsp; So much for De Tassy.&nbsp; No; but something 
more yet: and better, for he tells me his Print of the Mantic is 
finisht, &lsquo;in proofs,&rsquo; and will be out in about a 
Month: and he will send me one.&nbsp; Now, my dear Cowell, 
can&rsquo;t I send one to you?&nbsp; Yes, we must manage that 
somehow.</p>
<p>Well, I have not turned over Johnson&rsquo;s Dictionary for 
the last month, having got hold of &AElig;schylus.&nbsp; I think 
I want to turn his Trilogy into what shall be readable English 
Verse; a thing I have always thought of, but was frightened at 
the Chorus.&nbsp; So I am now; I can&rsquo;t think them so fine 
as People talk of: they are terribly maimed; and all such Lyrics 
require a better Poet than I am to set forth in English.&nbsp; 
But the better Poets won&rsquo;t do it; and I cannot find one 
readable translation.&nbsp; I shall (if I make one) make a very 
free one; not for Scholars, <!-- page 331--><a 
name="page331"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 331</span>but for 
those who are ignorant of Greek, and who (so far as I have seen) 
have never been induced to learn it by any Translations yet made 
of these Plays.&nbsp; I think I shall become a bore, of the 
Bowring order, by all this Translation: but it amuses me without 
any labour, and I really think I have the faculty of making some 
things readable which others have hitherto left unreadable.&nbsp;
But don&rsquo;t be alarmed with the anticipation of another 
sudden volume of Translations; for I only sketch out the matter, 
then put it away; and coming on it one day with fresh eyes trim 
it up with some natural impulse that I think gives a natural air 
to all.&nbsp; So I have put away the Mantic.&nbsp; When I die, 
what a farrago of such things will be found!&nbsp; Enough of such
matter. . . .</p>
<p>Friday, June 5!&nbsp; What an interval since the last 
sentence!&nbsp; And why?&nbsp; Because I have been moving about 
nearly ever since till yesterday, and my Letter, thus far 
written, was packt up in a Box sent down hither, namely, 
Gorlestone Cliffs, Great Yarmouth.&nbsp; Instead of the 
Regent&rsquo;s Park, and Regent Street, here before my windows 
are the Vessels going in and out of this River: and Sailors 
walking about with fur caps and their brown hands in their 
Breeches Pockets.&nbsp; Within hail almost lives George Borrow 
who has lately published, and given me, two new Volumes of 
Lavengro called &lsquo;Romany Rye,&rsquo; with some excellent 
things, and some very bad (as I have made bold to write to 
him&mdash;how shall I face him!).&nbsp; You would not like the 
Book at all, I <!-- page 332--><a name="page332"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 332</span>think.&nbsp; But I must now tell you
an odd thing, which will also be a sad thing to you.&nbsp; I left
London last Tuesday fortnight for Bedfordshire, meaning to touch 
at Hertford in passing; but as usual, bungled between two 
Railroads and got to Bedford, and not to Hertford, on the Tuesday
Evening.&nbsp; To that latter place I had wanted to go, as well 
to see it, as to see N. Newton, who had made one or two bungled 
efforts to see me in London.&nbsp; So, when I got to Bedford, I 
wrote him a line to say how it was I had missed him.&nbsp; On the
very Saturday immediately after, I received a Hertford Paper 
announcing the sudden Death of N. Newton on the very Tuesday on 
which I had set out to see him!&nbsp; He had been quite well till
the Saturday preceding: had then caught some illness (I suppose 
some infectious fever) which had been visiting some in his house;
died on the Tuesday, and was buried on the Thursday after!&nbsp; 
What will Austin do without him?&nbsp; He had written to me about
your Hafiz saying he had got several subjects for Illustration, 
and I meant to have had a talk with him on the matter.&nbsp; What
should be done?&nbsp; I dare not undertake any great 
responsibility in meddling in such a matter even if asked to do 
so, which is not likely to be unless on your part; for I find my 
taste so very different from the Public that what I think good 
would probably be very unprofitable.</p>
<p>When in Bedfordshire I put away almost all Books except Omar 
Khayy&aacute;m!, which I could not help looking over in a Paddock
covered with Buttercups <!-- page 333--><a 
name="page333"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 333</span>and brushed
by a delicious Breeze, while a dainty racing Filly of W. 
Browne&rsquo;s came startling up to wonder and snuff about 
me.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tempus est quo Orientis Aur&acirc; mundus 
renovatur, Quo de fonte pluviali dulcis Imber reseratur; 
<i>Musi-manus</i> undecumque ramos insuper splendescit; 
Jesu-spiritusque Salutaris terram pervagatur.&rsquo;&nbsp; Which 
is to be read as Monkish Latin, like &lsquo;Dies 
Ir&aelig;,&rsquo; etc., retaining the Italian value of the 
Vowels, not the Classical.&nbsp; You will think me a perfectly 
Aristophanic Old Man when I tell you how many of Omar I could not
help running into such bad Latin.&nbsp; I should not confide such
follies but to you who won&rsquo;t think them so, and who will be
pleased at least with my still harping on our old Studies.&nbsp; 
You would be sorry, too, to think that Omar breathes a sort of 
Consolation to me!&nbsp; Poor Fellow; I think of him, and Oliver 
Basselin, and Anacreon; lighter Shadows among the Shades, 
perhaps, over which Lucretius presides so grimly.&nbsp; Thursday,
June 11.&nbsp; Your letter of April is come to hand, very 
welcome; and I am expecting the MS. Omar which I have written 
about to London.&nbsp; And now with respect to your proposed 
Fraser Paper on Omar.&nbsp; You see a few lines back I talk of 
some lazy Latin Versions of his Tetrastichs, giving one clumsy 
example.&nbsp; Now I shall rub up a few more of those I have 
sketched in the same manner, in order to see if you approve, if 
not of the thing done, yet of</p>
<p>(<i>letter breaks off abruptly at the end of the 
page</i>.)</p>
<p><!-- page 334--><a name="page334"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
334</span>June 23.&nbsp; I begin another Letter because I am 
looking into the Omar MS. you have sent me, and shall perhaps 
make some notes and enquiries as I go on.&nbsp; I had not 
intended to do so till I had looked all over and tried to make 
out what I could of it; since it is both pleasant to oneself to 
find out for oneself if possible, and also saves trouble to 
one&rsquo;s friends.&nbsp; But yet it will keep me talking with 
you as I go along: and if I find I say silly things or clear up 
difficulties for myself before I close my Letter (which has a 
month to be open in!) why, I can cancel or amend, so as you will 
see the whole Process of Blunder.&nbsp; I think this MS. 
furnishes some opportunities for one&rsquo;s critical faculties, 
and so is a good exercise for them, if one wanted such!&nbsp; 
First however I must tell you how much ill poor Crabbe has been: 
a sort of Paralysis, I suppose, in two little fits, which made 
him think he was sure to die: but Dr. Beck at present says he may
live many years with care.&nbsp; Of this also I shall be able to 
tell you more before I wind up.&nbsp; The brave old Fellow! he 
was quite content to depart, and had his Daughter up to give her 
his Keys, and tell her where the different wines were laid!&nbsp;
I must also tell you that Borrow is greatly delighted with your 
MS. of Omar which I showed him: delighted at the terseness so 
unusual in Oriental Verse.&nbsp; But his Eyes are apt to cloud: 
and his wife has been obliged, he tells me, to carry off even the
little Omar out of reach of them for a while. . . .</p>
<p>June 27.&nbsp; Geldestone Hall.&nbsp; I brought back my <!-- 
page 335--><a name="page335"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
335</span>two Nieces here yesterday: and to-day am sitting as of 
old in my accustomed Bedroom, looking out on a Landscape which 
your Eyes would drink.&nbsp; It is said there has not been such a
Flush of Verdure for years: and they are making hay on the Lawn 
before the house, so as one wakes to the tune of the 
Mower&rsquo;s Scythe-whetting, and with the old Perfume blowing 
in at open windows. . . .</p>
<p>July 1.&nbsp; June over!&nbsp; A thing I think of with 
Omar-like sorrow.&nbsp; And the Roses here are blowing&mdash;and 
going&mdash;as abundantly as even in Persia.&nbsp; I am still at 
Geldestone, and still looking at Omar by an open window which 
gives over a Greener Landscape than yours.&nbsp; To-morrow my 
eldest Nephew, Walter Kerrich, whom I first took to school, is to
be married in the Bermudas to a young Widow.&nbsp; He has chosen 
his chosen sister Andalusia&rsquo;s Birthday to be married on; 
and so we are to keep that double Festival. . . .</p>

<p>Monday, July 13.&nbsp; This day year was the last I spent with
you at Rushmere!&nbsp; We dined in the Evening at your 
Uncle&rsquo;s in Ipswich, walking home at night together.&nbsp; 
The night before (yesterday year) you all went to Mr. 
Maude&rsquo;s Church, and I was so sorry afterward I had not gone
with you too; for the last time, as your wife said.&nbsp; One of 
my manifold stupidities, all avenged in a Lump now!&nbsp; I think
I <!-- page 336--><a name="page336"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Anniversary of my departure from Rushmere.&nbsp; I went from you,
you know, to old Crabbe&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Is he too to be wiped away
by a yet more irrecoverable exile than India?&nbsp; By to-morrow 
I shall have finisht my first Physiognomy of Omar, whom I 
decidedly prefer to any Persian I have yet seen, unless perhaps 
Sal&aacute;m&aacute;n. . . .</p>
<p>Tuesday, July 14.&nbsp; Here is the Anniversary of our Adieu 
at Rushmere.&nbsp; And I have been (rather hastily) getting to an
end of my first survey of the Calcutta Omar, by way of 
counterpart to our joint survey of the Ouseley MS. then.&nbsp; I 
suppose we spoke of it this day year; probably had a final look 
at it together before I went off, in some Gig, I think, to 
Crabbe&rsquo;s.&nbsp; We hear rather better Report of him, if the
being likely to live a while longer is better.&nbsp; I shall 
finish my Letter to-day; only leaving it open to add any very 
particular word.&nbsp; I must repeat I am sure this Calcutta Omar
is, in the same proportion with the Ouseley, by as good a hand as
the Ouseley: by as good a hand, if not Omar&rsquo;s; which I 
think you seemed to doubt if it was, in one of your Letters. . .

<p>Have I previously asked you to observe 486, of which I send a 
poor Sir W. Jones&rsquo; sort of Parody which came into my mind 
walking in the Garden here; where the Rose is blowing as in 
Persia?&nbsp; And with this poor little Envoy my Letter shall 
end.&nbsp; I will not stop to make the Verse better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Allen</span>,</p>
<p>One should be very much gratified at being remembered so long 
with <i>any</i> kindness: and how much more gratified with so 
kind Remembrances as yours!&nbsp; I may safely say that I too 
remember you and my Freestone days of five and twenty years ago 
with a particular regard; I have been telling my Nieces at the 
Breakfast Table this morning, after I read your letter, how I 
remembered you sitting in the 
&lsquo;<i>Schoolroom</i>&rsquo;&mdash;too much sheltered with 
Trees&mdash;with a large Watch open before you&mdash;your Sister 
too, with her light hair and China-rose Complexion&mdash;too 
delicate!&mdash;your Father, your Mother, your Brother&mdash;of 
whom (your Brother) I caught a glimpse in London two years 
ago.&nbsp; And all the <i>Place</i> at Freestone&mdash;I can walk
about it as I lie awake here, and see the very yellow flowers in 
the fields, and hear that distant sound of explosion in some 
distant Quarry.&nbsp; The coast at Bosherston one could never 
forget once seen, even if it had no domestic kindness to frame 
its Memory in.&nbsp; I might have profited more of those <!-- 
page 338--><a name="page338"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
338</span>good Days than I did; but it is not my Talent to take 
the Tide at its flow; and so all goes to worse than waste!</p>
<p>But it is ungracious to talk of oneself&mdash;except so far as
shall answer some points you touch on.&nbsp; It would in many 
respects be very delightful to me to walk again with you over 
those old Places; in other respects sad:&mdash;but the pleasure 
would have the upper hand if one had not again to leave it all 
and plunge back again.&nbsp; I dare not go to Wales now.</p>
<p>I owe to Tenby the chance acquaintance of another Person who 
now from that hour remains one of my very best Friends.&nbsp; A 
Lad&mdash;then just 16&mdash;whom I met on board the Packet from 
Bristol: and next morning at the Boarding House&mdash;apt then to
appear with a little <i>chalk</i> on the edge of his Cheek from a
touch of the Billiard Table Cue&mdash;and now a man of 
40&mdash;Farmer, Magistrate, Militia Officer&mdash;Father of a 
Family&mdash;of more use in a week than I in my Life long.&nbsp; 
You too have six sons, your Letter tells me.&nbsp; They may do 
worse than do as well as he I have spoken of, though he too has 
sown some wild oats, and paid for doing so.</p>
<p><i>My</i> family consists of some eight Nieces here, whom I 
have seen, all of them, from their Birth upwards&mdash;perfectly 
good, simple, and well-bred, women and girls; varying in 
disposition but all agreed among themselves and to do what they 
can in a small Sphere.&nbsp; They go about in the Village here 
with some consolation both for Body <!-- page 339--><a 
name="page339"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 339</span>and Mind 
for the Poor, and have no desire for the Opera, nor for the Fine 
Folks and fine Dresses there.&nbsp; There is however some 
melancholy in the Blood of some of them&mdash;but none that mars 
any happiness but their own: and that but so slightly as one 
should expect when there was no Fault, and no Remorse, to 
embitter it!</p>
<p>You will perhaps be as well entertained with this poor 
familiar news as any I could tell you.&nbsp; As to public 
matters, I scarcely meddle with them, and don&rsquo;t know what 
to think of India except that it is very terrible.&nbsp; I always
think a Nation with great Estates is like a Man with 
them:&mdash;more trouble than Profit: I would only have a 
<i>Competence</i> for my Country as for myself.&nbsp; Two of my 
very dearest Friends went but last year to Calcutta:&mdash;he as 
Professor at the Presidency College there: and now he has to 
shoulder a musket, I believe, as well as deliver a Lecture.&nbsp;
You and yours are safe at home, I am glad to think.</p>
<p>Please to remember me to all whom I have shaken hands with, 
and make my kind Regards to those of your Party I have not yet 
seen.&nbsp; I am sure all <i>would be</i> as kind to me as others
who bear the name of Allen <i>have been</i>.</p>
<p>Once more&mdash;thank you thank you for your kindness; and 
believe me yours as ever very truly,</p>

<p>I hope things will not be so black with you and us by the time
this Letter reaches you, but you may be amused and glad to have 
it from me.&nbsp; Not that I have come into Suffolk on any 
cheerful Errand: I have come to bury dear old Mr. Crabbe!&nbsp; I
suppose you have had some Letters of mine telling you of his 
Illness; Epileptic Fits which came successively and weakened him 
gradually, and at last put him to his Bed entirely, where he lay 
some while unable to move himself or to think!&nbsp; They said he
might lie so a long time, since he eat and drank with fair 
Appetite: but suddenly the End came on and after a twelve hours 
Stupor he died.&nbsp; On Tuesday September 22 he was buried; and 
I came from Bedfordshire (where I had only arrived two days 
before) to assist at it.&nbsp; I and Mr. Drew were the only 
persons invited not of the Family: but there were very many 
Farmers and Neighbours come to pay respect to the remains of the 
brave old Man, who was buried, by his own desire, among the poor 
in the Churchyard in a Grave that he wishes to be no otherwise 
distinguisht than by a common Head and Footstone. . . .</p>
<p>You may imagine it was melancholy enough to me to revisit the 
house when He who had made it <!-- page 341--><a 
name="page341"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 341</span>so warm for
me so often lay cold in his Coffin unable to entertain me any 
more!&nbsp; His little old dark Study (which I called the 
&lsquo;<i>Cobblery&rsquo;</i>) smelt strong of its old Smoke: and
the last Cheroot he had tried lay three quarters smoked in its 
little China Ash-pan.&nbsp; This I have taken as a Relic, as also
a little silver Nutmeg Grater which used to give the finishing 
Touch to many a Glass of good hot Stuff, and also had belonged to
the Poet Crabbe. . . .</p>
<p>Last night I had some of your Letters read to me: among them 
one but yesterday arrived, not very sunshiny in its prospects: 
but your Brother thinks the Times Newspaper of yesterday somewhat
bids us look up.&nbsp; Only, all are trembling for Lucknow, 
crowded with Helplessness and Innocence!&nbsp; I am ashamed to 
think how little I understand of all these things: but have wiser
men, and men in Place, understood much more? or, understanding, 
have they <i>done</i> what they should? . . .</p>
<p>Love to the dear Lady, and may you be now and for time to come
safe and well is the Prayer of yours,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cowell</span>,</p>
<p>You will recognize the Date of my Abode.&nbsp; Two years ago 
you were coming to see me in it much about this Season: and a 
year ago I wrote you my first Letter to India from it.&nbsp; I 
came hither from <!-- page 342--><a name="page342"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 342</span>Brighton a week ago: how long to be 
here uncertain: you had best direct to Goldington Hall, 
Bedford.&nbsp; I sent you a short Letter by last 
Marseilles&rsquo; Post from Brighton: and I now begin this short 
one because I have happened again to take hold of some Books 
which we are mutually interested in.&nbsp; I have left with 
Borrow the Copy of the Mantic De Tassy gave me; so some days ago 
I bought another Copy of Norgate.&nbsp; For you must know I had 
again taken up my rough Sketch of a Translation, which, such as 
it is, might easily be finisht.&nbsp; But it is in truth no 
Translation: but only the <i>Paraphrase of a Syllabus</i> of the 
Poem: quite unlike the original in Style too:&mdash;But it would 
give, I think, a fair proportionate Account of the Scheme of the 
Poem.&nbsp; If ever I finish it, I will send it you.&nbsp; Well; 
then in turning this over, I also turned over Volume I of 
Sprenger&rsquo;s Catalogue, which I bought by itself for 6s. a 
year ago.&nbsp; As it contains all the Persian MSS. I supposed 
that would be enough for me.&nbsp; I have been looking at his 
List of Att&aacute;r&rsquo;s Poems.&nbsp; What a number!&nbsp; 
All almost much made up of <i>Apologues</i> in which Att&aacute;r
excels, I think.&nbsp; His Stories are better than 
J&aacute;m&iacute;&rsquo;s: to be sure, he gives more to pick out
of.&nbsp; An interesting thing in the Mantic is, the stories 
about Mahm&uacute;d: and these are the best in the Book.&nbsp; I 
find I have got seven or eight in my brief Extract.&nbsp; I see 
Sprenger says Att&aacute;r was born in 513&mdash;four years 
before poor Omar Khayy&aacute;m died!&nbsp; He mentions one of 
Att&aacute;r&rsquo;s Books&mdash;&lsquo;The Book of Union,&rsquo;
<i>waslat</i> <!-- page 343--><a name="page343"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 343</span><i>n&aacute;mah</i>, which seems to 
be on the very subject of the Apologue to the 
<i>Peacock&rsquo;s</i> Brag in the Mantic: line 814 in De 
Tassy.&nbsp; I suppose this is no more the Orthodox 
<i>Mussulman</i> Version than it is ours.&nbsp; Sprenger also 
mentions as one separate Book what is part of the 
Mantic&mdash;and main part&mdash;the <i>Haft wady</i>.&nbsp; 
Sprenger says (p. 350) how the MSS. of Att&aacute;r differ from 
one another.</p>
<p>And now about old Omar.&nbsp; You talked of sending a Paper 
about him to Fraser and I told you, if you did, I would stop it 
till I had made my Comments.&nbsp; I suppose you have not had 
time to do what you proposed, or are you overcome with the Flood 
of bad Latin I poured upon you?&nbsp; Well: don&rsquo;t be 
surprised (vext, you won&rsquo;t be) if <i>I</i> solicit Fraser 
for room for a few Quatrains in English Verse, however&mdash;with
only such an Introduction as you and Sprenger give me&mdash;very 
short&mdash;so as to leave you to say all that is Scholarly if 
you will.&nbsp; I hope this is not very Cavalier of me.&nbsp; But
in truth I take old Omar rather more as my property than yours: 
he and I are more akin, are we not?&nbsp; You see all [his] 
Beauty, but you don&rsquo;t feel <i>with</i> him in some respects
as I do.&nbsp; I think you would almost feel obliged to leave out
the part of Hamlet in representing him to your Audience: for fear
of Mischief.&nbsp; Now I do not wish to show Hamlet at his 
maddest: but mad he must be shown, or he is no Hamlet at 
all.&nbsp; G. de Tassy eluded all that was dangerous, and all 
that was characteristic.&nbsp; I think these <i>free</i> opinions
are less dangerous in an old <!-- page 344--><a 
name="page344"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 344</span>Mahometan, 
or an old Roman (like Lucretius) than when they are returned to 
by those who have lived on happier Food.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
what you will say to all this.&nbsp; However I dare say it 
won&rsquo;t matter whether I do the Paper or not, for I 
don&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;ll put it in.</p>
<p>Then&mdash;yesterday I bought at that shop in the Narrow 
Passage at the end of Oxford Street a very handsome small Folio 
MS. of Sadi&rsquo;s Bost&aacute;n for 10s.&nbsp; But I 
don&rsquo;t know when I shall look at it to read: for my Eyes are
but bad: and London so dark, that I write this Letter now at noon
by the Light of two Candles.&nbsp; Of which enough for 
To-day.&nbsp; I must however while I think of it again notice to 
you about those first Introductory Quatrains to Omar in both the 
Copies you have seen; taken out of their Alphabetical place, 
<i>if they be Omar&rsquo;s own</i>, evidently by way of putting a
good Leg foremost&mdash;or perhaps <i>not</i> his at all.&nbsp; 
So that which Sprenger says begins the Oude MS. is manifestly, 
not any Apology of Omar&rsquo;s own, but a Denunciation of him by
some one else: <a name="citation344"></a><a href="#footnote344" 
class="citation">[344]</a> and is a <i>sort</i> of Parody (in 
<i>Form</i> at least) of Omar&rsquo;s own Quatrain 445, with its 
indignant reply by the Sultan.</p>
<p>Tuesday Dec. 22.&nbsp; I have your Letter of Nov. 
9&mdash;giving a gloomy Account of what has long ere this been 
settled for better or worse!&nbsp; It is said we are to have a 
Mail on Friday.&nbsp; I must post this Letter before then.&nbsp; 
Thank you for the MSS.&nbsp; You will let me know what you expend
on them.&nbsp; I have been <!-- page 345--><a 
name="page345"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 345</span>looking 
over De Tassy&rsquo;s Omar.&nbsp; Try and see the other Poems of 
Att&aacute;r mentioned by Sprenger: those with Apologues, etc., 
in which (as I have said) Att&aacute;r seems to me to 
excel.&nbsp; Love to the Lady.&nbsp; I have no news of the 
Crabbes, but that they do pretty well in their new home.&nbsp;

dwindle away too.&nbsp; I have not turned to Persian since the 
Spring; but shall one day look back to it: and renew my attack on
the &lsquo;Seven Castles,&rsquo; if that be the name.&nbsp; I

not to lose what little knowledge I had.&nbsp; As to my Omar: I 
gave it to Parker in January, I think: he saying Fraser was 
agreeable to take it.&nbsp; Since then I have heard no more; so 
as, I suppose, they don&rsquo;t care about it: and may be quite 
right.&nbsp; Had I thought they would be so long however I would 
have copied it out and sent it to you: and I will still do so 
from a rough and imperfect Copy I have (though not now at hand) 
in case they show no signs of printing me.&nbsp; My Translation 
will interest you from <!-- page 346--><a 
name="page346"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 346</span>its 
<i>Form</i>, and also in many respects in its <i>Detail</i>: very
unliteral as it is.&nbsp; Many Quatrains are mashed together: and
something lost, I doubt, of Omar&rsquo;s Simplicity, which is so 
much a Virtue in him.&nbsp; But there it is, such as it is.&nbsp;
I purposely said in the very short notice I prefixed to the Poem 
that it was so short because better Information might be 
furnished in another Paper, which I thought <i>you</i> would 
undertake.&nbsp; So it rests.&nbsp; Nor have I meddled with the 
Mantic lately: nor does what you say encourage me to do so.&nbsp;
For what I had sketcht out was very paraphrase indeed.&nbsp; I do
not indeed believe that any readable Account (unless a prose 
Analysis, for the History and Curiosity of the Thing) will be 
possible, for <i>me</i> to do, at least.&nbsp; But I took no 
great pleasure in what I had done: and every day get more and 
more a sort of Terror at re-opening any such MS.&nbsp; My 
&lsquo;<i>Go&rsquo;</i> (such as it was) is <i>gone</i>, and it 
becomes <i>Work</i>: and the Upshot is not worth <i>working</i> 
for.&nbsp; It was very well when it was a Pleasure.&nbsp; So it 
is with Calderon.&nbsp; It is well enough to sketch such things 
out in warm Blood; but to finish them in cold!&nbsp; I wish I 
could finish the &lsquo;Mighty Magician&rsquo; in my new way: 
which I know you would like, in spite of your caveat for the 
Gracioso.&nbsp; I have not wholly dropt the two Students, but 
kept them quite under: and brought out the religious character of
the Piece into stronger Relief.&nbsp; But as I have thrown much, 
if not into Lyric, into Rhyme, which strikes a more Lyric Chord, 
I have found it much harder to <!-- page 347--><a 
name="page347"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 347</span>satisfy 
myself than with the good old Blank Verse, which I used to manage
easily enough.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Vida es Sue&ntilde;o&rsquo; 
again, though blank Verse, has been difficult to arrange; here 
also Clarin is not quenched, but subdued: as is all 
Rosaura&rsquo;s Story, so as to assist, and not compete with, the
main Interest.&nbsp; I really wish I could finish these some 
lucky day: but, as I said, it is so much easier to leave them 
alone; and when I had done my best, I don&rsquo;t know if they 
are worth the pains, or whether any one (except you) would care 
for them even if they were worth caring for.&nbsp; So much for my
grand Performances: except that I amuse myself with jotting down 
materials (out of Vocabularies, etc.) for a Vocabulary of 
<i>rural</i> English, or <i>rustic</i> English: that is, only the
best country words selected from the very many Glossaries, etc., 
relating chiefly to country matters, but also to things in 
general: words that carry their own story with them, without 
needing Derivation or Authority, though both are often to be 
found.&nbsp; I always say I have heard the Language of Queen 
Elizabeth&rsquo;s, or King Harry&rsquo;s Court, in the Suffolk 
Villages: better a great deal than that spoken in London 
Societies, whether Fashionable or Literary: and the homely 
[strength] of which has made Shakespeare, Dryden, South, and 
Swift, what they could not have been without it.&nbsp; But my 
Vocabulary if ever done will be a very little Affair, if ever 
done: for here again it is pleasant enough to jot down a word now
and then, but not to equip all for the Press.</p>

Dictionary; and these I shall strike a little Fire out of by and

finisht a metrical Paraphrase and Epitome of the Mantic: but you 
would scarce like it, and who else would?&nbsp; It has amused me 
to give a &lsquo;Bird&rsquo;s Eye&rsquo; View of the Bird Poem in
some sixteen hundred lines.&nbsp; I do not think one could do it 
as Sal&aacute;m&aacute;n is done.&nbsp; As to Omar, I hear and 
see nothing of it in Fraser yet: and so I suppose they 
don&rsquo;t want it.&nbsp; I told Parker he might find it rather 
dangerous among his Divines: he took it however, and keeps 
it.&nbsp; I really think I shall take it back; add some Stanzas 
which I kept out for fear of being too strong; print fifty copies
and give away; one to you, who won&rsquo;t like it neither.&nbsp;
Yet it is most ingeniously tesselated into a sort of Epicurean 
Eclogue in a Persian Garden.</p>

<p>&lsquo;One day we had Alfred Tennyson here; an unforgettable 
day.&nbsp; He staid with us till late; forgot his stick: we 
dismissed him with Macpherson&rsquo;s Farewell.&nbsp; Macpherson 
(see Burns) was a Highland robber; he played that Tune, of his 
own composition, on his way to the gallows; asked, &ldquo;If in 
all that crowd the Macpherson had any clansman?&rdquo; holding up
the fiddle that he might bequeath it to some one.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Any kinsman, any soul that wished him well?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Nothing answered, nothing durst answer.&nbsp; He crushed the 
fiddle under his foot, and sprang off.&nbsp; The Tune is rough as
hemp, but strong as a lion.&nbsp; I never hear it without 
something of emotion,&mdash;poor Macpherson; tho&rsquo; the 
Artist hates to play it.&nbsp; Alfred&rsquo;s dark face grew 
darker, and I saw his lip slightly quivering!&rsquo;</p>

In holy Meditation among Men<br />
Had spent, but, wishing, ere he came to close<br />
With God, to meet him in complete Repose,<br />
Withdrew into the Wilderness, where he<br />
Set up his Dwelling in an ag&egrave;d Tree<br />
Whose hollow Trunk his Winter Shelter made,<br />
And whose green branching Arms his Summer Shade.<br />
And like himself a Nightingale one Spring<br />
Making her Nest above his Head would sing<br />
So sweetly that her pleasant Music stole<br />
Between the Saint and his severer Soul,<br />
And made him sometimes [heedless of his] Vows<br />
Listening his little Neighbour in the Boughs.<br />
Until one Day a sterner Music woke<br />
The sleeping Leaves, and through the Branches spoke&mdash;<br />
&lsquo;What! is the Love between us two begun<br />
And waxing till we Two were nearly One<br />
For three score Years of Intercourse unstirr&rsquo;d<br />
Of Men, now shaken by a little Bird;<br />
And such a precious Bargain, and so long<br />

even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
